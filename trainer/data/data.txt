and there's wicked amusing pop up images and memes from the based broadcaster! <eos>
that one made me laugh <eos>
#stickied!!!! the world must know about what trump has doneeeeee!!!!!!! this really happened right? i mean we don't need proof for these things right????? ------ [awww - so cute.](<url> ["are you kidding me?!"](<url> <eos>
lou dobbs on fox business is right up there too. <eos>
lou cracks me up. i liked him when i was a drooling liberal (he was on msnbc back then). i now like him again after i woke up. <eos>
thank you sean hannity. there is at least one honest journalist in the media. the truth has to get out. <eos>
major gabbard served her country honorably. the dnc hates that she can't be coopted to serve the hrc coronation. <eos>
the dnc "doesn't trust her judgment", apparently because she thinks for herself and forms her own opinions. <eos>
i followed the election very closely at the time of the sanders campaign and now that i think back in it, this woman was so incredibly gutsy to do what she did its ridiculous. she will be president one day. check out r/tulsi <eos>
well, when you're used to having a committee to form a tweet, that's pretty unusual. <eos>
source: <url> edit: as predicted, as soon as this post his the first page of r/all the ctr downvotes poured in. who downvotes a american hero combat medic?! the left... <eos>
he finishes up by saying "wahhhhh, we no give u money!!!!". i hope she replied by saying "hey darnell, why don't you and michael go fuck yourselves?" by the way, why can't michael reach out to her like a fucking real man? why does he need to hide behind darnell like this? what a little cuck boy! representative gabbard probably thought she had no choice but to quietly sit there and eat shit back then, when that inarticulate cock sucker threw his petulant litttle temper tantrum; but instead she has been revealed to be principled and uncorruptible, a true american hero, through and through. i doubt she has much love for our candidate, but that's ok, i have nothing but respect and admiration for her. <eos>
god damnit. look at that picture. just look at it. that is presidential material. beautiful, principled, honorable, brave. this is the kind of woman who should have the honor of becoming the first female president. not the scuzzbucket sleazeball war-loving rape-enabling sociopoathic corrupt treasonous lying criminal sack of shit that hillary is. <eos>
100%. i'm a male and i want to see a female as president. nothing wrong with it at all, so long as she's qualified. clinton is most certainly not. <eos>
i wish more bernouts actually had a conscience like tulsi does. she's an awesome woman and one of the few in the democratic party to stand by her convictions. of course that is why they had to try and destroy her. she should have run instead of bernie as she would not have folded like a cheap suit. <eos>
as a coat wearing, disavowed bernout voting trump i agree. i'm all for a woman president, just not *this* woman. i'd happily vote for tulsi. <eos>
bingo. i'm so fucking tired of hearing that i "just resent" her. we've been 100% vindicated by wikileaks. <eos>
this country had a chance...i think bernie was robbed. bernie v trump would have been the greatest time for the country. there would have been a chance for catharsis. now we have epic levels of depression, anxiety, and hatred driving things. take me for instance. pre bern out, i was all about "one love man, we're all in this together" to post bern out "god fucking dammit i hate this woman and cannot fucking believe the extent and levels of corruption".... #**and we haven't even seen any of her emails yet!!!!** i'm so fucking tired of hearing that he's the personifcation of all the things that have been holding women back...**he's the god damned last line of defense for us against the worst scum in the universe.** <eos>
i haven't heard of this, what's the story? <eos>
here's the story... clinton allies punish super delegate for supporting sanders <url> <eos>
morals, integrity, and she spits in the face of the clintons. why the shit can't this woman be running for president? i'd vote for her <eos>
goldman sachs speeches. hillary's every word being planned by someone else. keeping the emails from obama <eos>
saudi arabia funding both isis and shillary. this is a fact that breaks the conditioning of shillary people. <eos>

#cnn breaking: white male trump protester assaults innocent journalists <eos>
cnn: trump sends assassination squad to our headquarters. <eos>
we're gonna need some video fellow patriot... <eos>
we had about 20 at max. not a lot of people but a whole lot of energy. <eos>
well... by the same math used by clinton to claim how many show up to see her speak: 20 x 400 = i do not recall...so let's say you had 13000 people there. <eos>
honestly, i'm beginning to love that tree-hugger. <eos>
should trump offer stein the top epa job in exchange for her endorsement? that could be worth a couple percent <eos>
the sub of which we cannot speak has been shitting all over her. same thing a lot of republicans did to ron paul supporters and other libertarians who wouldn't vote for mccain or romney. <eos>
> the sub of which we cannot speak this like some harry potter level shit right now, like when the ministry of magic began tracking people who say voldemort <eos>
here we have the ministry of meme magic <eos>
i strongly disagree with most of jill stein's views, but i do respect her for not bending the knee to hillary like bernie did. <eos>
jill stein dropping wind totems on twitter daily. <eos>
she outright said the other day that trump is better than hillary. that's about as close to an endorsement of trump as you're going to get from someone like her. <eos>
magic crystal plant grandma is so based. probably voting maga even though her name is on the ballot too. <eos>
trump, a billionaire businessman, has done more to help black americans than the first black president has. let that sink in. <eos>
oh it sunk in awhile ago. <eos>
>two of the most prominent black figures in american history, **ever** >they give trump an award for helping minority communities. >trump is a racist. that's one hell of a thought process. if only i had the mental gymnastics training to navigate around rational thought like that. are rosa parks and ali...uncle toms? <eos>
omg drumpf is a black supremacist? <eos>
that's why he mentions the inner cities so much during the debates. he legit cares for the issues there and knows that fixing them fixes a fuck ton of problems <eos>
#b-b-but muh racism <eos>
what happened to ctr? i see shillposts on /pol all the time, but i'm starting to think it's more ironic shitposting than actual subversion. duodad do you think it's weird to see a real life cyberpunk red guard enacting some k. dick dystopia right here, right now? weird, eh? <eos>
i've seen a lot of strange stuff today. i saw a brilliant post on here with 1500+ points and scores of comments... blink back to 50 points and two comments. we should go asymmetrical and take the fight to them. <eos>
recruit ctr. you know how paranoid those guys have to be? if one of them flip, the rest are all going to prison. seriously, take the fight to them, find the first one to flip and give him immunity if he can take down david brock and the rest. <eos>
wow, i can't find a single positive comment on her fb page comments. perhaps we should share this with all our friends on facebook, something like: "dear friends, if you are considering to vote for hillary, or have already voted for her, please visit her fb page, and read the comments from her other fans. (insert link) <eos>
i've noticed that a ton of the people blasting her on fb are middle aged women. she is losing big with her biggest demographic right now. my own mother shits on hillary on her own feed all the time, and just this morning sent me an article about how all the groping accusations against trump are totally false, and said "i can't believe how obviously fake these scandals all are. how are they getting published?" <eos>
indians are basically fucking white males because they figured out the dark, evil secret of how we got all our privilege: 1. have kids later in life. 2. stay married to your partner rather than letting them raise kids alone. 3. actually hound your kids to succeed in school. 4. prioritize education and starting businesses over having the latest cars or clothes. 5. pool family resources together to make sure nobody gets left behind. 6. make your communities wholesome, supportive places to live by not perpetrating crime or violence on one another. because they found out our secret, they can't be controlled with the pitiful promise of hand-outs and relaxing policing standards in their communities. dems have nothing else to offer. <eos>
respect to phil for not only turning it down, but also informing us about it and saying it's not his place to tell us how to vote. <eos>
yeah, i like phillyd. he does daily videos on current events, and he isn't completely retarded. i watch him on weekdays, but i don't care for his weekend shows. <eos>
wouldn't be surprised to find out that the youtubers are not the only ones being paid to endorse hillary <eos>
i support hillary clinton ^^for ^^prison <eos>
that's fucking pathetic. <eos>
why? i thought she's got this in the bag! <eos>
that explains the sudden casey nistate video of him endorsing hillary from 3 days ago... also, i love philip dafranko, been watching his shit since 2009. hes so unbiased and in the middle, hes the type of reporters we need on tv <eos>
she will refuse to attend <eos>
she wants mandatory drug testing on our kids, but won't take one herself. <eos>
if i have to take a piss test for work why can't she? <eos>
even if she does a drug test, what difference will it make? the results will be rigged! <eos>
journalism is dead. propaganda is alive. <eos>
i love this crazy woman. <eos>
i just hope russia, if they're going to take any action (if obama and the fuck nuts start something), they wait till after the election to see who gets elected. putin has to know that trump wants the us and russia to be allies, not enemies. <eos>
yup, he doesn't want his country at war... he wants to run it as the leader and keep illegals out and kill terrorists. he wants to keep power, and war will risk losing that power... though he won't run from it. <eos>
putin may be evil in his own sense and is in no way an admirable person (re: killing journalists), but at least he puts his country and its citizens first <eos>
i love this adorable pepe a little more every time it's posted. he looks like a muppet baby. <eos>
potus got himself into this mess and for it allowing to go this far <eos>
and now he's campaigning more for hillary than hillary campaigns for herself! you would think the current president of the united states might have something more important to attend to with all his time... <eos>
his writters you mean, when he's not reading from a teleprompter and actually has to think he is a stuttering mess. <eos>
if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if you say so <eos>
i don't know why this isn't pointed out more, it goes way beyond endorsement, it's like he's running again!! <eos>
he's putting in the same amount of energy as if he were in a re-election campaign. i think it's embarrassing for our country and completely unfair to our political system. to have our sitting president fly around in air force one doing tons of events for a presidential candidate...disgraceful. <eos>
he's running for dear life. in his mind, if trump wins, the depth of the corruption comes out, and no one will be around to pardon his sorry globalist ass. <eos>
exactly. they both can pardon each other, whichever way the wind ends up blowing. <eos>
this is honestly one of the best mails. <eos>
bigleaguetruth <eos>
woah, secret service going to be tested... book it! <eos>
we must get the compiled lists of crap from the emails to the trump campaign. the witch is going down! (but not on bubba) <eos>
she is dying <eos>
>she is dying this fucking crusty cunt better don't die before she's gets thrown in jail. <eos>
not before she gets out of prison <eos>
you assume her sentence would be based on years. <eos>
an upvote a day keeps the globalist at bay. <eos>
she is detoxing, because she is building tolerance to her anti seizure medication and needs to be ready for the debate. she is also the only candidate that goes down in the polls the more she appears, hence why they have an army of people stumping for her...obama, michelle, gore, kaine, biden, the rapist. god forbid she win. who is going to run the country for the disappearing president? <eos>
and you see that long list of "events"...only **one** is a rally and it's because obama is the speaker. the rest are all fundraisers and voter registration events. super low-energy. pathetic! <eos>
at least she is showing up for the 3rd debate, so trump can crush her like he did in the 1st two debates. <eos>
we haven't even seen his final form yet. <eos>
i hope he verbally strikes her down as a golden nimbus of light encircles his head. he turns towards the cameras, stepping over hillary's shattered and twitching form, looking directly into the cameras and says "join me, unite this fractured land and together we will make this nation great again and assume our place as a starfaring race across the stars!" <url> <eos>
she's still in the burn unit after the second debate <eos>
**insiders say she is dropping out** <eos>
bu..bb.b..but shes the climate change candidate :( <eos>
her rally with al gore seems like a joke now(it already was) <eos>
hot tip: al gore doesn't believe in climate change either. <eos>
al gore was an early investor, and is heavily invested in green energy but it's not like he has anything to gain or anything. <eos>
you know what, i'd give it to him. if he has the foresight to look past nonrenewable energy and invest in "green" energy, then good on him. hillary can go fuck herself. edit.) a letter <eos>
[removed] <eos>
get a life is in the attachments of this <url> edit: the pro fracking stuff is in here <url> <eos>
i bet al gore feels like a bit of a douche today then. dragging his uncharismatic backside out of bed to campaign for hillary, only to be told that his little film was boring and that he needs to get a life and crank up the energy consumption! <eos>
he knew the whole time. <eos>
oops, i know a couple of friends who aren't gonna be happy about this <eos>
if they are hillary supporters they will just ignore it, say "theres probably more to the story", and then not care. <eos>
bye bye bernie voters.. <eos>
this bitch hates everyone. yeah let's elect her, fucking liberals disgust me <eos>
#tremendous hate in her heart <eos>
running list of hillary and her camp showing contempt and disdain for the american people: thinks **climate change activists** should "get a life." **bernie supporters** are young uninformed naive basement dwellers. **trump supporters** are irredeemably deplorable. they are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic. **bill clinton's rape victims** are a bunch of tramps. **latinos** are needy taco bowls. **blacks** are super predators who need to be brought to heel. also, "blacks always fare badly, irrespective of circumstances". **whites** need to listen better. <eos>
sorry to correct the record, but it was only *half* of trump supporters, <eos>
that's her *public* position. you don't want to know about her private position. <eos>
she's also privately against gay marriage. <eos>
you could strap one of her supporters to a chair, point them at a t.v, show them all the leaks, emails and read them every word she said and they'd still be like, "dee dee dee she's innocent hurr i'm still voting for her durr this just makes her stronger" <eos>
bill's privately against his marriage to her <eos>
#wew <eos>
also wants to implement mandatory drug testing for kids and teenagers on a national level. <eos>
i've gotten "lectured" by dimwits in /r/trees about this before, and they all have the same stupid retort: "mike pence is 10 million times worse for weed".. get ready for this to be their only comeback. i can't comment on it as i am canadian and know literally nothing about pence <eos>
shouldn't matter since the trump pence campaign has made it abundantly clear that pence is going to support trumps platform even if it goes against his personal ideology, and trump has made it clear he will not hinder the states' decisions even if he won't support national legalization. <eos>
/r/the_redacted wouldn't want you to know that though. <eos>
she's owned by big pharma. of course she's against legalization. she's also owned by the banks, saudi arabia, qattar. big business and foreign country's are 90% of her campaign donations. do your own research on the candidates and don't pay attention to what the media says, wiki leaks has already exposed that clinton absolutely controls them. just watch, in about two minutes this thread will be flooded by correct the record folks downvoting and saying hillary is the second coming. <eos>
his daughter is having some pepecorn <eos>
fucking angry white male. <eos>
i am one of the 750k! <eos>
we can make a yuuuge impact on her numbers--remember, just as o'reilly is ending, immediately turn off the tv or switch the channel before her show even begins. then, click fox back on for hannity. fox will soon get the message, loud and clear! <eos>
how dare you post a map with boarders!!!! how are r/[redacted] going to sleep tonight. <eos>
only one was his ex-wife during the divorce, but she denied it this year as well and he was the best man at her second wedding, so i'm guessing she was just angry <eos>
> he was the best man at her second wedding mfw you're so alpha they ask you to be the best man at your ex wife's wedding <eos>
trump's the best man at any wedding he attends <eos>
six foot 20, fucking killing for fun. <eos>
it's all fake stories to hide the avalanche of wikileaks destroying hillary's campaign. hillary is appearing at no events in october. i wish she would stay hid forever. <eos>
was also thinking along these lines during his speech today. not one speech at any of his events has he ever sniffed like he does in the debates. <eos>
he didn't sniff during any of the gop debates and he had some long rants during them. <eos>
i don't even know how many dimensions of chess this is - i've entirely lost track! and i love it! <eos>
here's to hoping that the nyt gets gawker'd real soon. <eos>
lol the few companies that do back trump will get kickbacks, but they will come from trump supporters not shady backroom deals. <eos>
[removed] <eos>
that's extremely unsettling. i've been saying this for a while -- she is way too calm, way too removed from the public space. she knows she's going to win because i fear they've got this whole thing fixed. <eos>
i don't know why libs throw the same old tired attacks against donald that they normally would use against any other republican. those attacks against trump don't work because he's not overly conservative in a social sense like many republicans are. <eos>
this was the man who helped destroy gawker. hopefully new york times is next! <eos>
so wtf can we do about this seriously? <eos>
1. if your state allows absentee ballot, like florida, order it. 2. if not, see if there is a paper option or early voting option with paper. 3. cry. <eos>
to the top! i almost got chills. <eos>
in all seriousness this pic is rich in symbolism. what better symbol of our rotten political system than the teleprompter? invisible to the crowd, it enables politicians to thoughtlessly deliver their trite, meaningless focus grouped drivel. polished. professional. on message. the experts tell us that using it makes one seem not aloof or fake, but "presidential." but here we see something altogether different. the symbol of american politics is broken. the thing we aren't supposed to see has captured the attention of everyone in the crowd. and the man at the podium just stops, smiles, tells us plainly that it doesn't work anymore, then tears it apart and keeps on going. <eos>
the only thing hrc has ever done for black people is pander to them <eos>
i'm voting for trump out of shear spite for the american political establishment that has allowed this election to happen. i don't care what his policies are, i don't care about the lies the media has told us about him. i want him to fuck. shit. up. he is the first one to take our side, to fight against the establishment that has demonized rural folk, white men, and people who have worked hard for their lives. <eos>
yeah i can't believe i'm quoting. michael moore (he's a closet trump supporter), nevertheless, "i’ve been trying to say for months here, i live in michigan. across the midwest, across the rust belt, i understand why a lot of people are angry. they see donald trump as their human molotov cocktail, that they get to go into the voting booth on november 8th and throw him into a political system that has made their lives miserable miserable.” <eos>
haha this is hillarious <eos>
is she assuming your gender!? wtf!? she just assumed it's gender?!?!?!? nice balls btw. <eos>
perfect response. absolutely perfect. <eos>
when you use their responses they use on trump against them.. they don't know it and see it as "smoking crack" behavior... so they attempt their logic is smoking crack logic <eos>
your game is strong, sir. <eos>
>why do you hate men so much? daddy issues. unavailable, neglectful or abusive father during childhood. which may or may not extrapolate to a series of relationships later on with similar types of men. might be an experimental lesbian to 'rebel' against male sexuality. <eos>
let's start with drug testing before the next debate. <eos>
just what we need, another diseased, no-talent, plasticized, fake-ass ratchet-ho giving us profane wisdom about things she knows nothing about. <eos>
not to mention she dating a nigga who holds the record for most ls in one year ---- <url> <url> <url> <url> <url> <url> <eos>
poor nicki, she is getting so old she almost doesn't matter anymore. <eos>
because bill clinton will be a better first lady ....? <eos>
yeah you're common street trash, nicki <eos>
minaj is repulsive, not only physically, but in every other possible way. i'd imagine the stench exuding from that sub-human is worse than a rancid puddle of recently ingested and vomited fecal matter. <eos>
that's because this racist, ghetto skank feels intimidated and inferior to melania! this ghetto degenerate thinks by putting on expensive clothing you can pretend to have class. melania can be in a burlap bag and exude class. the old line that "you can't polish a turd" perfectly describes this ghetto skank! <eos>
#based roosevelt <eos>
im a liberal thats voting for trump it just used to be that before sjws being liberal meant something else <eos>
literally and metaphorically. <eos>
but trump mentioning voter fraud could cause irreversible damage! it's says so on r/redactedcucks! obviously talking about voter fraud is worse then commiting it... videos of democrats stuffing ballot boxes, ripping up republican votes, ww1 veterans miraculously voting for hillary, but no, it's trump mentioning voter fraud that's the dangerous part <eos>
is he trying to imply that zombies shouldn't be able to vote?!?!?!? #sexist, racist, bigot, egotistical, xenophobic, antisemitic, literally hitler, name calling, bully <eos>
russia and assad blocked a saudi based pipeline through syria to sell to eu. saudi then: 1) went to war with russia 2) flooded their oil on market to drive down prices to hurt russia 3) unlease isis on syria to take out assad 4) donate $50m to clinton foundation 5) us state dept now on board to overthrow assad 6) blame russia for everything as they must stop protecting assad 7) ??????????????????? 8) us goes to war against united nations security counsel vote, they remove assad 9) syria is a failed state 10) isis takes over 11) saudis have a new pipeline and protection 12) hillary uses this new red scare to control the media and masses. 13) dissidents are labeled unamericana and arrested, social media closed down she is working with isis to overthrow assad like she did gaddafi. russia is not happy. putin has called back students and relatives to the motherland. russian television is warning of nuclear war soon. **president hillary means wwiii. we have to come out of the closet as trump supporters, now.** **maga** <eos>
some of us remember a friendly, well spoken, civil assad with a pleasant appearance on the daily show before be magically became our enemy for no reason. fyi the people that assad was accused of 'oppressing' was al qaeda. <eos>
stanford? no, you can't trust their research study. they are a super conservative school. it is obvious they have a bias against democrats. /s <eos>
numbers always have leaned conservative. <eos>
love it!!! you should make some into christmas ornaments and sell them. <eos>
i'd by those <eos>
ill make one for you :) you can request a custom order on my etsy <url> <eos>
god bless capitalism. good for you. i will be referring everyone i know to your shop. <eos>
that pac-man one is so cool looking <eos>
thanks! i've only just started making glass, only about 4 months or so now. i really appreciate all the encouragement :) <eos>
you'd literally be __buying pepe__. glorious. <eos>
do you have a cool story? what do those close to you think of you wanting to maga? <eos>
my family loves america. we are christian arabs who immigrated here to escape from muslim persecution. we all love trump and love that he will crush isis! <eos>
my family loves assad because he kept the muslims at bay and protected the christians, jews, kurds, etc. from being slaughtered and enslaved by them. thankfully a lot of us have gotten out, but not everyone. our village is mostly out of the way, so the war has not reached my family yet, but we are terrified of what will happen if muslims get to them. the men will be killed and the women will be sold as sex slaves and raped to death, most likely. it is a hard thing to believe that my cousins are waking up every morning with that possibility. we send aid to them as much as we can, but recently its been harder. the media paints out leaders like mubaruk, assad, gaddafi, houssein, and the like as horrible dictators and the rebels as peaceful freedom fighters, but the rebels are all islamic extremists who want to kill everyone who isn't muslim and implement sharia law. <eos>
amazing. we love our christian refugees don't we folks?! <eos>
a christian refugee?! john kerry on suicide watch! <eos>
you could sell literally millions of those!! <eos>
wish my country had this much enthusiasm with a national movement. <eos>
what are you talking about? your country is known worldwide for tier 1 shitposting. now that is a national movement to be proud of. ffs...dropbears will be one of my all time favourite memes. <eos>
now sit back and let my mother and i lecture you about your fucking a white male privilege. <eos>
funniest one was the [person who called a holocaust survivor a "privileged white male".](<url> edit: unrelated. wasn't talking about this link. <eos>
they're acting like he wants to tattoo mexicans and force them into work/death camps rather than enforce this country's laws. they're called illegal for a reason. it won't be long before the left starts calling home invasion 'uninvited entrance'. <eos>
something is fucky about all this. <eos>
to be fair, her apartment really is a medical facility dedicated to keeping hillary's corpse animated. that texhnology has to be expensive <eos>
no, you've never had to **worry** about money, you dumb bitch. you certainly care. you don't understand what those words mean. <eos>
she can't help it... with her parents she didn't have a shot in the dark at being a decent human being... <eos>
you leave webb hubbell out of this. <eos>
holy shit i hope she ends up living under a bridge. <eos>
if you mean a bridge in saudi arabia, i agree. an american bridge would be far too good for a clinton. <eos>
how in the hell do you spend $3m on a wedding? is the cake made out of cocaine? i know they can become expensive quickly what with food, decorations, reserving a location, paper products for invitations, etc. but *damn* three. million. dollars. <eos>
fucking entitled cunt <eos>
$600k no talent (basically a no show) job <eos>
if you murdered someone and the cops kept coming to your door to ask questions, are they picking on you? fucking whiny liberals. <eos>
thats what shits me with lefties "why wont wikileaks expose trump" 1. msm is already shilling for hillary; wikileaks is balancing that out. 2. maybe theres nothing to expose. 3. hillary has more or less threatened to kill assange <eos>
>maybe theres nothing to expose. he is a businessman in high level real estate. high profile hotels and such are designed to be public things by definition. there are a lot of disincentives to being shady. hillary has had a similar length career in which back door deals and secrecy is an accepted norm. this generates more skeletons. also, she just seems a lot more criminally inclined. <eos>
assange said trump exposes himself very well on his own. <eos>
all the commenters are saying trump supporters did this, wtf <eos>
come on, you and me both know it was the russians. <eos>
that's not been proven. it could have been the russians. it could also have been the chinese. or it could have been a sjw that weighs 400 pounds. <eos>
#at this point what difference does it make?!?!?! <eos>
it's funny because they spray painted "nazi republicans leave town or else" on an adjacent building as well. <eos>
hurts r/ctr's idea that this was a trump supporter going to war against the rnc. we may hate the rnc leadership, but even if we were dumb enough to take it out on the rank and file who largely support trump, nazi would be a weird insult. we don't think their nazi's at all; just cucks. <eos>
unfortunately, i don't think ben is ever coming home.. <eos>
###manlets. when. will. they. learn. <eos>
that sounds like something ben is asking himself rather than to his audience. <eos>
yeah ben was very reluctant to board the trump train, dunno where he at now. <eos>
buying five inch platforms so he can stand at 5'9 <eos>
sounds like hillary needs to tone down her rhetoric and she still hasn't disavowed. <eos>
funnily enough, if it had been trump supporters bombing some place, ben probably would have been saying how he knew this would happen. <eos>
had to unfollow him months ago.. his twitter turned into a cuckfest.. <eos>
**to clear up some confusion:** wikileaks is tweeting out hashes. they're not passwords to unlock a file, but a digital fingerprint to prove it's authenticity. this is likely prep for future releases. wikileaks will release files related to john kerry, ecuador, and the fco. you can compare the hash of the file that you downloaded with the one in the tweet. if it doesn't match, you know that your file is not authentic and was tampered. hashes are useful for any downloads, particularly sensitive ones that wikileaks releases. <eos>
thank you. correct. <eos>
i've been telling people, if even 1 character is different in the entire archive file...the entire hash will be different. <eos>
excellent! as time goes on the current algorithms get weaker. md5 is no longer considered secure, but not long ago it was "unbreakable". currently, your desktop computer can generate md5 collisions - files that are different but have he same hash. it's important to not only understand what a hash is but to be current too. hopefully the people releasing files use current hashing alogos. this hash on twitter is sha256 but i mention md5 because it was very very popular and ubiquitous not long ago. <eos>
assange is playing one high stakes game of chess isn't he? these emails are slowly going up the chain, everyday. now whatever this will be <eos>
thank pamela anderson, she gave him the boost to destroy clinton. <eos>
pamela anderson is there when we need her. <eos>
she went in to relieve him of his blue balls as a thanks for his based leaking. <eos>
that is kind of weird though isnt it? i dont know their history at all. are they a long time friend? has she ever mentioned what he is doing? <eos>
he's probably fucking with the clinton at this point. they know he has campaign ending material, and have been trying to buy him off in any way possible. he probably demanded something outrageous like "send pam anderson to bring me lunch". <eos>
assange: ["you know we continue to annoy her, which is good fun actually."](<url> <eos>
he wouldn't be australian if he didn't enjoy that <eos>
too bloody right. aussies love crushing bastards. <eos>
lol assange texting hillary like: "bring me the baddest bitch you got or else!" <eos>
looks like 2 more were just tweeted out [pre-commitment 2: ecuador](<url> [pre-commitment 3: uk fco](<url> update: [tweet by state department retweeted by uk fco, involving kerry](<url> wouldn't be surprised that these are checksums to verify that they had this information before the announcement, to confirm their authenticity. looks like some shady shit is about to happen. <eos>
since he mentioned ecuador and the uk, could the uk be negotiating with the ecuadorian embassy to get him out, and this is his way of telling the uk, ecuador, and the us to all back the fuck off? otherwise why else would he mention ecuador? a pre-commitment like this is a threat. if he's threatening ecuador, the embassy must be thinking about handing him over. <eos>
yeah looks like monday going to be busy <eos>
i wonder what tomorrow's distracting national tragedy will be. "unarmed" black man shot by white cops and a subsequent race riot in another big city? a mass shooting? a terrorist attack? oh boy. eat your wheaties tomorrow morning, folks! <eos>
oh gosh ur right. they have some stupid shit ready i bet <eos>
for the non-techie centipedes: these are not encryption keys, but hash values. whats a hash value? it is a "fingerprint" of a file or text string that is easy to compute if you have the source content, but impossible to reverse. example: the sha265 hash for "make america great again" (without the quotes) is 10672cb3457840cd94be313e91691ce3017095c4eb917a111f537943ec2624c9. it is impossible to retrieve the original information just from the hash (except for simple words with few characters), but it is very easy to verify that the original string or file is indeed some given hash. the hash values posted by wikileaks could be used in two ways: - there is some sort of leak being released in the next few days and those hash values belong to those files. that way anyone who downloads that release can calculate the hash for that file and verify they its the real deal and the release has not been messed with (if a single bit is changed in the archive, it results in a entirely different hash value) - it could be some statement that was hashed. it contains knowledge/proof of something. for example, if he releases the hash of the string: "hillary clinton killed scalia" (again, without the quotes)... he can later proof that he already had written this string at the time he released the hash value. again: the hashes itself are not some encrypted message. also, they are not a "key" for anything. they are proof/verification for something upcoming. <eos>
we are living history right now <eos>
i was going to get an early night (uk here) adrenaline ruined last sunday nights sleep... now this. it's like the fappening all over agin. no complaints no brakes <eos>
this is some next level wizard shit. assange has transformed into code, he is unplugged and roaming through the cyberworld. he is loose in the matrix, and john kerry is gonna get btfo'd! <eos>
assange has drawn a line in the sand, cross it, dare you. <eos>
fyi <url> sounds interesting. <eos>
its going down! <eos>
#im yellin' timberrrr <eos>
my god. it's like some bourne identity shit - are we in a movie right now? there's not enough popcorn!!! <eos>
i'm pretty sure he's ramping it up. by november he'll be droned and we'll have obama bin laden selfies and grays smoking weed in an illuminati board room. ayy fucking lmao. <eos>
they're not going to drone an embassy <eos>
don't put anything past #killary. <eos>
obama may do it. it's legal as long as there is no intent. <eos>
my tendies are tingling. <eos>
probably proving to someone the person they're talking to is really wikileaks <eos>
whats this. is this encryption for someone? <eos>
this is a 256 bit hex hash key. it is likely the generated hash for a file/archive download. basically, if you download it from the correct source and run a sha-256 sum on the archive, such as a zip...it would match that 64 bit key exactly. if someone changed even 1 character in the zip, (like a bad individual)..the 64 bit hash would be 100% different. <eos>
either it's a warning for people to back the fuck off him, or some decisions have been made and they are going forward with an upcoming release. <eos>
the phrase "pre-commitment" is key [precommitment](<url> is a strategy of threatening someone with higher cards if they act. one of the most famous ones is the soviet ["dead hand"](<url> project, designed to launch soviet nukes in the event the ussr was attacked. it's a fail deadly system. this is a dead man's key threat. <eos>
the mythical dead mans key? <eos>
unlikely. a dump file is likely on it's way, and this is for people who download it to run a 256shasum against it to confirm it is authentic. <eos>
thank you for the explanation, based centipede. it helps us less technically inclined deplorables! <eos>
just invite druid-grandma and that stoner guy from new mexico. it would be a great debate! <eos>
that would be the best thing ever. every candidate but hillary. and they shouldn't even mention her or even allude to her the entire time. just pretend she doesn't exist and go on with the election without her. <eos>
the only way hillary will not debate is if she is too sick to make it through.. <eos>
the next debate will be a rek-fest. she will find an excuse not to attend it, especially that trump wants her to take drug tests lmao. <eos>
trump could encourage them to skip the debate and then hold a debate with stein, and they could bitch against hillary together. <eos>
look at me -- im helping. <eos>
love you fam. <eos>
love you too man, texas also holds big value. nyers trying but our state is too blue. <eos>
your state is red, but you are over shadowed by nyc. <eos>
but many undecideds 15% <eos>
just people who have yet to hear about the wikileaks. stay vigilant. go out and vote <eos>
if only egghead mcmuffin would piss off <eos>
make it + 1 more from utah. ballot was put in the mail on friday. <eos>
they have a group that soros is funding to try to change catholic doctrine. uh, how about islam? pretty sure they're going to get some push back on that one. <eos>
>"11 point gain from the last poll!" 6. <eos>
now if they had offended muslims, they'd be groveling and beg for their mountain of apologies to be accepted. <eos>
that's because they need the muslims to come here and to destroy us in order for them to control us. that is all they want, more power and control. absolutely abominable. islam literally means submission, isn't that the perfect fit for a global state? a people who submit themselves to the higher powers wilfully and without question? <eos>
wow. the left is so hypocritical. these scumbags are nothing but excuses and lies. <eos>
this. he said that the emails could have been tampered with or not real at all and then said that "opinions don't need to be apologized for", thereby confirming they are real. um... tim? that means you can't bash trump anymore for saying "piggy" or "fat" <eos>
isn't this dude supposedly catholic? <eos>
he's the, abortion is okay, jesus was just a man if he even existed period, but if he was real he would be in favor of communist world governance type of catholic <eos>
he is whatever overlord hillary tells him to be. <eos>
they leave out the most inflammatory comment **that it's a bastardization of the faith** fuck kaine is human garbage. a slime of the lowest order. just trash <eos>
you can't apologize when you have no moral compass at all. <eos>
this is a movement <eos>
#this is a revolution <eos>
guys. while a brexit-upset is possible and likely, stop counting on it. as i've said before, brexit had hundreds of thousands of volunteer canvassers, phonebankers, and no election fraud. their demographics are different, their problems and issues are different. let's not get complacent. <eos>
we're not counting on it. we're going to vote. plain and simple. also, i'd say we have similar issues and concerns compared to great britain in general (economy, immigration, over-regulation for example). however, i do agree fraud may be more of a problem with this election. <eos>
not even counting the berniebros voting trump! <eos>
media will probably blame trump. <eos>
president trump: animals representing hillary clinton and dems in north carolina just firebombed our office in orange county because we are winning @ncgop <eos>
graffiti said "nazi republicans leave town or else!" pretty ironic that the perpetrators of a violent firebombing that could have killed innocent people are calling *us* the nazis. <eos>
they will. they'll blast him for using the word 'animals'' and how divisive his rhetoric is. they will completely forgive the heinous act that precipitated it, in large part, because msm agrees with the actions. <eos>
i'm hearing more and more people do this, despite the fact that when i tell them the media is responsible for the divisive attitude they agree with me. <eos>
i posted about it on another board i'm on and the response i got was: "this is terrible. this is the exact reason why we have to stand against negative political strategies on both sides. i see it as entirely the fault of both sides." that seems to be thing now. make it into "it's both sides' fault". <eos>
when it's republicans, it's because republicans are evil. when it's democrats it's because both sides are wrong. <eos>
it's the 'ole "you incited me to be violent!!!" they never take responsibility for their actions. <eos>
cnn this morning was claiming that allegedly an unnamed 'trump supporter' was calling for bloodshed. headline was literally something like "we want bloodshed" -trump supporter. and that was basically the end of the story. extremely low energy cnn <eos>
cnn interviewed a gay muslim woman who was offended by the supporters words, saying "it's extremely ignorant and bigoted of them to not see how this is perfectly within their right to free speech" <eos>
gay muslim woman.. somehow that seems very contradictory to me <eos>
say hi to huma. <eos>
cnn isn't exactly known for consistency <eos>
yeah they're more like free flowing diarrhea <eos>
cnn claimed, today, that it is illegal to view the leaked materials. "it's illegal to possess, uh, these stolen documents. it's different for the media. so everything you're learning about this, you're learning from us.” <url> cnn is lying to you. the emails were made available in the form of thousands of pdfs by the us state department as a result of a freedom of information act request. the congressional research service makes it clear that no one has ever been prosecuted for reviewing leaked materials (provided you, yourself, didn't leak them) and that any prosecution for simply reviewing the materials would be impossible because of first amendment protections. the supreme court made a ruling, following the publishing of the pentagon papers, that specifically addresses this issue, where the first amendment supersedes the espionage act. <url> point being, the willingness of the media to flat out lie to the public is in overdrive, right now, because of the elections. the misquoting and editorializing is designed specifically to prevent you from making an informed decision. if nothing else, the leaks provide an opportunity for everyone to see how the democratic party operates within their own organization, as it interacts with the government, donors and even news organizations. the raw data provides a lot more insight than the cherry picking and sharp shooting the media engages in. here is the link to the clinton emails: <url> this is a small, cherry picked, sample: *clinton campaign started obama is a muslim message in 2008 <url> *deciding which emails not to turn over, despite subpoena - <url> *hillary knew qatar & saudi arabia funded isis but continued to take their money anyway, as well as work out deals to sell arms to them. <url> *qatar giving her husband a $1m birthday present. for what? <url> *clinton foundation was in charge of rebuilding haiti but used it as an excuse to line pockets of friends and family. this one is discussing hillary's brother, tony rodham. <url> *admitting dnc is crooked (bernie never had a chance) <url> *donna brazile sharing debate question with hillary in advance - <url> *fake craigslist ad her campaign made about trump, but i am sure all of these new women coming forward couldn't have possibly come from this same group - <url> *trying to hide donors - <url> *getting inside dos intel (server scandal) - <url> *hillary's real views on wall street (but check out her released speeches for even more details) <url> *won't raise money for food crisis in west africa because organization raising money had called them out for their lack of success in helping haiti. <url> *uranium deal (learn more about this on youtube clinton cash) <url> *attempts to change il primary - <url> campaign chief owned 75,000 shares in putin connected energy company. <url> *admitting wall st speeches would be harmful if they get out. <url> *trump is real change - <url> *debbie wasserman schultz giving inside scoop on convention in advance - <url> *media collusion / biased media (there are tons of these) - -debate moderator john harwood (cnn/nyt) <url> -brent budowsky (the hill) - <url> -matt lee & bradley klapper (ap) - <url> -mark hosenball (reuters) <url> <eos>
"animals," the great triggering of 2016 has begun! <eos>
#and the hillshills' red glare, the cucks bursting in air... <eos>
this one time i disagree with trump. animals are pure and good. those terrorists are below animals. <eos>
they have a dilemma. if they want to pretend to be outraged about "animals" they have to report on the gop firebombing. <eos>
you know pc culture has gone too far when you can't call terrorists animals. <eos>
they're not terrorists, #they'rewithher. <eos>
cnn: "trump calls hillary supporter animals" <eos>
cnn: "it's illegal to visit trump's campaign site, get your news on trump here." <eos>
debate moderator: 'mr. trump, do you believe tweeting a firebomb report before the facts are in is presidential?' debate moderator: 'ms. clinton, can you answer #3 from the debate questions our news agency sent to your campaign?' <eos>
# but trump brought this upon himself by saying mean things! <eos>
remember kids, victim blaming is totally okay if the victim is a republican! <eos>
it's crazy because people actually think this. on my facebook, i said how lesser holt was a very biased moderator and someone commented how "he was supposed to be impartial for trump because he's a sexist misogynist" what a joke. <eos>
i see so many facebook posts calling trump supporters "ignorant, racist, lunatics" among other things. the left had done an outstanding job dehumanizing us. <eos>
what makes me even angrier is that clinton is running a campaign of how there is a deplorable and fringe group of people trump is legitimatizing who love divisiveness and how we all need to unite - not divide - because unification is what makes this country strong. it's such a dehumanizing remark masquerading as a call for unity, togetherness, and coming together whilst dehumanizing trump supporters for being fringe neo-nazis and therefore implying an encouragement of violence towards all of trump supporters, considering how vile and deplorable we are. trump believes in "stronger together". not "i am proud to have republicans as enemies" hillary clinton. edit: forgot to say, even worse is how this implied call for violence is actually happening and hillary clinton does not care. they are dehumanizing us for political gain, and by definition because we are dehumanized we are not looked at as humans who deserve the rights humans are implied to have. <eos>
wait it was in orange county? fuck i live here. i guarantee you it was someone from unc. <eos>
i have a feeling the rnc/dnc are trying to pull a jo cox-type incident, in which the perpetrator will turn out to be an insane/fake trump supporter, so that they blame all of us for this. <eos>
i've thought that too. if the globalists are willing to do that for brexit, i'm sure they're willing to do it for our election. <eos>
#calling them animals is not fair to animals!!! <eos>
the night is darkest before the don! stay strong centipedes, we will be vindicated on november 8th! <eos>
trump tells it as is. we're facing animals folks. <eos>
and not the cuddly kind 🐸 <eos>
and definitely not pepe <eos>
just left the state fair in nc. saw 100's of people wearing trump pence stickers. saw two 16 y/o trigglypuffs wearing "vote democratic", not even hillary stickers <eos>
i love this tweet. for the sole reason it will force the drive by media to report on the event. <eos>
president trump has never been wrong on calling these attacks. remember that. <eos>
i really hope authorities find out who did this. both the bomber and hillary should share the same jail cell <eos>
eh, i dunno, i'd prefer hillary not be jailed adjacent to an explosives enthusiast, wouldnt want her breaking out. <eos>
chapel hill is in orange county, it's filled to the brim with nutjob liberal transplants. they don't represent the rest of the state. they come here for 2-4 years, take advantage of everything here while talking shit about our state and our politics. they're doing the same thing in texas and other southern states. <eos>
#for the frightened cucks worried about how strong his language is: this is 5d intergalactic backgammon. #he is baiting the media into attacking him for this tweet which necessitates them covering the firebombing itself. nobody is going to care about his words when they see the pictures. #calm your tits. <eos>
maybe it is 6d chess and there is a tape of crooked calling blacks "animals" <eos>
ten bucks says the perpetrators will end up being black, and the media will have another field day. <eos>
loved the top comment on his fb: all of a sudden, puff - - no usa think, all of this in less than 8 years - just think about it!!! before obama, there was virtually no outlandish presence of islam in america. • all of a sudden, islam is taught in schools. christianity and the bible are banned in schools. • all of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses. • all of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons . • all of a sudden, we are inundated with lawsuits by muslims who are offended by american culture. • all of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them. • all of a sudden muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with sharia law. • all of a sudden the attorney general of the united states vows to prosecute anyone who engages in "anti-muslim speech". • all of a sudden, jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of islam and isis, are emphatically declared they are not islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined not to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence." • all of a sudden, it becomes policy that secular middle east dictators that were benign or friendly to the west, must be replaced by islamists and the muslim brotherhood. • all of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from iraq and the middle east, giving rise to isis. • all of a sudden, america has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as obama's stated goal of a nuke-free america by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted. • all of a sudden, a deal with iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and hundreds of billions of dollars handed over to fund their programs. • all of a sudden america apologizes to muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage they perpetrate against our soldiers. • all of a sudden, the american navy is diminished to 1917 pre-world war i levels of only 300 ships. the army is at pre-1940 levels. the air force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the a-10 thunderbolt close air support fighter. a further drawdown of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress. • all of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by obama rendering the atlantic unguarded, none are in the middle east. • all of a sudden obama has to empty guantanamo bay of captured jihadists and let them loose in jihad-friendly islamic states. he demands to close the facility. • all of a sudden america will negotiate with terrorists and trade five taliban commanders for a deserter and jihad sympathizer. • all of a sudden there is no money for american poor, disabled veterans, jobless americans, hungry americans, or displaced americans but there is endless money for obama's "syrian refugee" resettlement programs. • all of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the usa. • all of a sudden, the most important thing for obama to do after a mass shooting by two jihadists, is disarm american citizens. • all of a sudden, the president of the united states cannot attend the christian funerals of a supreme court justice and a former first lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. ·all of a sudden the president of the united states won’t attend the funeral of a flag-rank officer (gen. greene) killed in action; he played golf. but he sends a big delegation to michael brown’s funeral. he sends a minor delegation to margaret thatcher’s funeral. he won’t acknowledge chris kyle’s murder but he’ll fly the flag at half mast for whitney houston. *all of a sudden, i’m sick to my stomach. i’m not sure the majority of americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much “progress” has been made by islam these last 7 years. the same islam that has been plaguing the world for thousands of years. <eos>
[official nc gop facebook post about the incident] (<url> <eos>
read through the comments, wtf that bimbo that said this is trumps fault. i just can't stop shaking my head at how retarded these people are. liberals burn down the gop office, blame the gop!!!!! that's the same line of thinking of blaming a woman who got raped that she shouldn't have been female and since she has a vagina was asking for it. <eos>
cultural marxism at work. you can put all the evidence in front of them but they won't listen. <eos>
\>they don't realize every time they do shit like this it actually helps trump <eos>
trump supporters stand with the people of north carolina as they investigate this terrorism. <eos>
lol. that's some good counter spin right there. <eos>
in large part, the media is to blame for this. <eos>
and the hateful clinton campaign. <eos>
democratic terrorism. <eos>
the left are actually blaming trump supporters for this.... <eos>
hillary will condemn the violence (she won't) <eos>
this will swell our numbers. the average american does not accept this bullshit. the silent majority is ours. <eos>
i wish the state gop would sue local media. <eos>
it is real news, so probably just here. <eos>
violence from the left ... always from the left. this is why we need trump more than ever. to stop this before it starts. <eos>
we've been calling them brownshirts from the beginning. anyone still doubt? <eos>
they had the gall to deface the property afterwards with "nazi republicans get out of town or else". if local media covers this at all it will be with high praise. it's awful here - local media in full overdrive hill-shilling. <eos>
and the shills are saying trump supporters mad at the gop did it. because i'm sure trump supporters would spray 'nazi republicans get out of town'. <eos>
yep, they're reporting the email where podesta was wishing the muslim shooter was a white guy. it's on the front page right now. <eos>
he wished it was chris hayes. called him out by name. <eos>
they just said it would be better if the names of the terrorist and the reporter were switched, i doubt they have anything against chris hayes <eos>
if someone said 2 months ago that fox news will deliver stuff like this, we would laugh at him. <eos>
thank god wiki pushed that murdoch email out! <eos>
if fox news will start covering the leaks heavily, the others will start covering them more to keep up. even if it's to try and discredit them, it will get the information in front of more people. if they don't, they know they'll lose *more* viewers to fox as people start to want more information... <eos>
there are zero yes zero articles on cnn or msnbc on the wikileaks. that's how you know they are part of the clinton campaign. <eos>
it's true!!! <eos>
i believe because cnn told me to get my news from the media only. <eos>
tomorrow - cnn: fox news is a confirmed russian alt-right propaganda channel <eos>
but don't forget guys, reading e-mails is **highly illegal** and the **clinton news network police** will come and arrest you if you question the narrative. <eos>
how the fuck did fox news become the least biased american msm news station? god, could've never predicted this 5 years ago... <eos>
i think it's more we have seen how biased the other news really is <eos>
cnn: trump encourages people to break the law <eos>
when 200 million citizens are breaking the law, it's time to change the law. <eos>
/r/trees has said that for years! <eos>
ding! <eos>
that's actually brilliant. send that to trump posthaste! <eos>
brilliant idea! that would be almost as good as "you'd be in jail" <eos>
after everything she says he should ask if that is her public or private stance. it would frustrate the crap out of her <eos>
/pol/ should reddirect hillaryclinton.com to wikileaks.org <eos>
of clintonkaine.com which i believe trump took over. lol <eos>
it would be another great debate killshot. he could even just shorten it to: "for the *real* facts, go to wikileaks." <eos>
that one is going to be a hard one to top. <eos>
did you email the campaign directly? <eos>
just did. thanks. <eos>
no, he should index the most damaging wiki leaks findings on his website in an easy to read digestible format. for the debates his entire website should be wiki leaks revelations and he should call people to go to his website multiple times during the debate. <eos>
this is the best idea. the op is a great 1 liner, which is powerful in and of itself, but we all know the ave public isn't going to sift through the leaks looking for the damaging ones, even if they possessed the requisite knowledge to ascertain them as such (they don't). <eos>
the silence by fox news and the top republicans is deafening. we are going to have to go in and clean them out. <eos>
factcheck: this post appears to be real, because op referred to 405 as "the 405"....something only done on socal (southern california). <eos>
there is a lot of underground trump support here in cali! just yesterday there was a flashmob rally in santa clarita! <eos>
it's past being funny.. it's shocking.. especially to an outsider here in canada, i just can't believe there is such a huge percentage of brainwashed population <eos>
white guys try to bomb muslims... blame trump. dems firebomb gop office.... blame trump. this is worse than 'thanks obama'... <eos>
dont forget the war in iraq, trumps fault too. <eos>
9/11 happened because he didn't release his taxes. <eos>
i've had it with cnn, they need to go down hard <eos>
she got raped because she dressed like a slut. <eos>
i think this is just the tip of the iceberg for the primaries. same situation with the rallies during the primaries; sanders was a god damned beast and clinton got like a handful of paid actors to clap for her a few times. i realize a lot of clinton voters are the stay at home on an oxygen tank type of people ... but this shit just does not even come close to adding up. <eos>
she must hibernate for 5 days straight in order to gather enough energy for the 90 minute debate. <eos>
lizards go into a process where they start shedding their skin, called 'molting'. it's probably a bit embarrassing for her, so she stays inside. nothing to worry about, it's a normal process for her species. <eos>
i think the best explanation is parkinsons. her meds work best when she hasn't been on them for a while, so she needs to be off her meds for several days before the debate so that she can look super healthy when 100m+ people are watching her. if only the audience knew that trump has done like ten thousand fucking rallies in the past 48 hours and is going to stand there looking healthier than her ... but get called out for his microphone picking up the sound of him inhaling through his nose. <eos>
punish high performers for race. break glass windows. tax them to death. tell them to leave. i do nazi anything similar that has happened in the past. <eos>
everyone sees it except for the hrc-affiliated camps. <eos>
damn i forgot about these... they crack me up. <eos>
i know, i don't know how cruz became the fucking third wheel sidekick, but it's always funny as hell. there's no place he won't go or task he won't commit to help the dahn. <eos>
i think the cruz memes started when that guy scaled trump tower. over time it evolved from "give me the delegates dahnald." to ted being trump's zodiac bodyguard. within the top 5 memes of this election for me. <-- lol fucking memology. <eos>
trump is sending his best weapon to protect julian...ted cruz. <eos>
hillary sends a drone. donald fires back a ted cruz missle! <eos>
**dahnald, hold these delegates, i'm going to save juhlian** <eos>
you see my fellow republicans, conservatives, and trump supporters it is when we keep fighting for what we believe in rather than apologizing and bending over backwards to the liberals who will undoubtedly call us racist, sexist, bigoted, violent, deplorable, and irredeemable that we have a chance to win. my fellow republicans, we didn't understand this in 2008 and 2012, we should understand this now. go out and vote for trump! remember that they can call you whatever they want but in the end, you have your vote and it is one heck of a time to be alive to vote for such an amazing candidate. a 100 years from now, this will be written in history books as a major moment in american politics. <eos>
is this not a federal crime? <eos>
yes. yes it is. tampering with mail in any way is. i'm sure ballots would bring an extra dimension to the crime. <eos>
call the police and make a report. <eos>
the police are with us. we can put these fuckers away. <eos>
go directly to jail. do not pass go, do not pick up 200 tendies. <eos>
how can they tell who people vote for through the sleeve unless they opened the ballots, invalidating them? they're trolling, but you should still alert local authorities if you know where they claim to be doing this <eos>
they literally just gave trump the evidence he needs to call the election into question. thanks, dipshits. <eos>
mods you gonna want this one on top <eos>
if you live in the uk and near the embassy. go to the fucking embassy. <eos>
nothing to worry about folks. nothing worrying about this escalation. nothing at all. no need to talk to your friends about censorship. cnn will tell you the (ministry's) truth. <eos>
the crooked and barry are actually going to start a fucking war with russia just to help the wretched bitch in an election. <eos>
this looks like the beginning of a war. what a time to be alive. <eos>
i cannot believe it is happening in america <eos>
the rest of the world is suprised it took you guys so long to figure it out. as an outsider looking in, it has been obvious for years that your media is compromised, that your democracy is just an illusion, and that the majority of the population is completely brainwashed by the tv. i worry that this is the america public's last chance at regaining control of their nation. the window of opportunity for change is begginig to close. <eos>
there is some blatant manipulation to votes. djt's ama was at like 13k upvotes, then dropped down to like 1k, then brought back up to ~3k. this was blatant manipulation. <eos>
this pretty much happens any time we hit the top of /r/all. and it's not just mass downvoting either, the math doesn't add up. <eos>
man in a suit just went in with like 8 full "harrods" bags. full of dongles hopefully. <eos>
very quiet here atm. found a spot where i can set up camp where i have a perfect view but i don't look suspicious. plan to stay for a few hours at least. i brought snacks. <eos>
i was mod here for 9 months, other mods will verify i am legit and not a bullshitter. i will upload photos later. don't want to waste phone battery now, want to stay as long as possible. hot asian lady just walked out. julian may have yellow-fever. #investigate <eos>
post pics in 30min intervals until a designated time when you plan to leave/end this adventure (tell us what time it will be). this will be your "ping". if you don't ping back during 2 consecutive intervals, then we know you were taken or something happened to you. serious, do this <eos>
will drain battery to upload pics before i get home, wanna stay as long as possible. i'll keep active in the thread though. i'll keep posting info. at least every 30 mins. <eos>
sad that centipedes have to have their own dead man switches. maga mbga <eos>
also sad that centipedes make much better journalists than msm <eos>
if you have pokemon go, drop mad lures around the embassy. the crowd of normies that will gather will prevent mi6 shenanigans from not being noticed. <eos>
oh.....my....god.... pokemon go literally can be used for clandestine purposes. what the fuck is 2016. <eos>
that would be hilarious! <eos>
lot's of expensive cars with blacked out windows are parked around, but that's not too unusual for this part of london so idk. and my snacks were walkers crisps. i finished the tea i brought within 5 minutes. gonna be a long afternoon. <eos>

no he left i think so i came to make sure everythings filmed. <eos>
well he just said he's outside the fucking embassy. <eos>

i think whenever the truth is revealed, all of our heads are going to explode. <eos>
it doesn't matter if they have it or not. the dead man switch will go off if it exists, and they'll have their revenge in short order. <eos>
if 14 operatives have no phone / internet, it's probable that the us knows where the dead man switches are <eos>
dan rolle is a member of the dnc who supported bernie. he's been outing dnc corruption and vote-rigging in nevada. apparently his internet has also been severed by cox communications and they stated his service would not be reinstated and "no comment" when asked why. <eos>
this is spicy !!! direct negotiations between fbi & granny´s campain! holy shit this is pure corruption. <eos>
patrick kennedy and the fbi are both scumbags <url> <eos>
inside sources report ctr shills in full panic mode we're winning the war and we're not even getting paid to do it the only reason they're still around is the $$$ <eos>
the shirt is fkin awsome. <eos>
it's hard enough being a white guy in nyc supporting trump, i can't imagine the shit that our minority/lgbtq/etc. friends get... stay strong brothers and sisters - we're all in this together! fight the good fight and win over the other side with patience, logic and the truth! <eos>
this is just cruel and low. they used the vulnerable--mentally ill, homeless, and poor--as punching bags for media play. <eos>
brown shirts from 1933. <eos>
so close to beating the end-game boss. <eos>
does anyone have that pixel art picture of trump in the video game overworld heading towards hillary as the final boss? edit: i found it! <url> <eos>
#fuck yes <eos>
how can they get kennedy to flip on his crooked boss? <eos>
yeah, they will throw kennedy under the bus and no mention in there of shillary. cuck chafeetz. <eos>
was just thinking the same thing, esp those at the san jose rally. this could potentially bring the entire dnc down... <eos>
i will never forget that day... came home from work and couldn't believe what i was seeing. turned me from a cruz constitutionalist to trump supporter by the end of the night.. absolutely disgusting to see how people were treated by just exercising their right to hear someone talk edit: chubby fingers <eos>

wait...did hrc attempt to make the protesters look like sander supporters to 'kill' 2 birds w one stone?? <eos>
today is the best christmas! <eos>
that's nice but we need proof hes still alive with updates <eos>
going for vacation in ecuador. when they ask me why i visit their country i will say : "thanks for supporting the dissemination of the fucking truth". <eos>
i love how stale shit stays on the top of all fucking ages, but real stuff that would sit on top gets pushed. i hate how this site has gotten, it used to be news before it happened. remember that reddit? <eos>
and youtube stopped the view counter. <eos>
youtube play count usually stops at 300+ views or something and takes a while to update. happens to any video that goes viral. <eos>
so ecuador gives assange asylum in london and now they're turning on him? am i understanding this correctly? <eos>
i think you're seeing goldman sachs pull the strings right now. more so than clinton. <url> >ecuador agreed to transfer more than half its gold reserves to goldman sachs group inc. for three years to give the government easier access to cash. >the central bank said it will send 466,000 ounces of gold to goldman sachs, worth about $580 million at current prices, and get the same amount back three years from now. in return, ecuador will get “instruments of high security and liquidity” and expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million over the term of the accord. goldman sachs is holding 466,000 ounces of ecuador's gold with the plan to return it mid 2017. what are the chances goldman sachs threatened them with this financial leverage. <url> edit: tl;dr goldman sachs bought the fucking country that was supposed to be protecting assange in 2014. <eos>
cutting off his internet is very different to handing him over. <eos>
yes, i'm aware. but blocking his ability to personally get this information out there? seems that they are starting to bend to the will of the system. <eos>
depends a lot of it is all theater. which is why we're seeing things like biden announcing attacks and assange's internet cut off. you don't stay alive as long as he has without having backup plans. all parties involved know that. <eos>
voltaire: "to determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: who is it that i am not permitted to criticize?" <eos>
so, we're ruled by fat, black, lesbian single mothers? /s <eos>
we still haven't fucking heard from assange yet. embassy said he's fine, volunteers for wikileaks said he's fine. why isn't assange coming out and saying everything's fine? <eos>
this is bad. <eos>
it was our government... by proxy. <eos>
poor little ecuador - i've gotta' believe the pressure from the obama admin. has been huge. us aid to ecuador has dropped from about $127 million in 2002 to just under $27 million in 2014 - been sliding the whole time under obama. their gdp was about $100b us in 2015. frankly, i'm surprised they've held out this long. maga 2016! <eos>
trump is the media now! <eos>
why isn't he doing it on his twitter too? <eos>
spread this video broadly and highlight the issues clearly when you link. <eos>
this debate is going to be the biggest fucking slaughter that has ever happened on national television. she's going to cancel. she's insane not to cancel. <eos>
she will just say that "everything donald just said is a lie" and direct people to visit her website for "fact-checking". she will non-stop bring up the sexual assault accusations. <eos>
my guess is snowden has a lot more digression in *what* he releases and assange just releases en masse. i like the *en masse* version way better. <eos>
finally you fucking twerp <eos>
the date she was paid & had a phone was 2/29. 11 days later trumps rally was cancelled in chicago. she clearly admitted she was part of the trump rally violence / shutdown in chicago. hillary directly paid her on 2/29, to protest & cause a disturbance on 3/11. pedes, get this to the top. weaponized autism at its finest. lock her up! <eos>
doesn't this make hillary directly culpable for the violence these people caused. it's like hiring a killer. <eos>
holy hell. where did the spreadsheet come from? <eos>
the federal elections committee website has all the expense information. <eos>
the real crime... they paid her on a leap year date....probably, hoped ppl would forget to look if they audited. <eos>
wtf... fuck fox. i thought they uncucked. <eos>
why? murdoch hates trump. <eos>
#birddogging removed from trending. other bullshit trending at 2k tweets. full on damage control <eos>
i'm seriously about to lose my god damn mind. how can no msm outlet be reporting james video! this country is so cucked it's ridiculous. <eos>
hidden camera tapes are only legit if they are damning to a republican. get with the facts. <eos>
this guy is like the poster child for r/punchablefaces <eos>
of course he is a cubs fan!! <eos>
give her a coat!!! we all just want freedom and out government back. <eos>
former berner here, same thing, just a lot earlier. the day bernie conceded was the day my wife and i came aboard the trump train. full speed ahead. maga express. <eos>
i wish there were a way to make browsing this sub mandatory for undecided voters. it's really made me realize that *gasp* trump supporters aren't what the media claims they are! hoping people wake up soon and we can all watch hillary go up in flames together! <eos>
reminder that none of o'keefe's previous videos were debunked. it's just a fucking liberal meme. if you ask for details on how they were debunked, there's absolutely nothing. <eos>
this is a much better indication of trump's national support, as opposed to the biased and unreliable polls. for the trump campaign, this is a **really good** sign. <eos>
its almost like being the one mass media pundit who is zeroed in on the mood of the electorate is beneficial for someone's viewer count or something. <eos>
to all of you people saying "crooked hillary" rigged the election... # the entire fucking american media machine is rigging the election, and teflon don is the one guy with the balls and the strength to take them on! <eos>
funny thing is she will still lose the election lol. <eos>
fucking four and five, yes! that's just common sense <eos>
no no, the usa should totally let the peaceful, pro-lgbt, non wife-beating muslim nations of qatar and saudi arabia interfere in the country. otherwise you're a racist and sexist, and probably a homophobe too! <eos>
and people say trump has no real policy proposals. <eos>
no real proposals that the establishment would ever consider... <eos>
#based trump tearing apart corrupt washington! #what a time to be alive! maga! <eos>
btw if clinton gets in its the opposite. ..all her behavior is validated and its fucking open season with govt corruption <eos>
she won't appoint you if she doesn't have blackmail over your head. <eos>
this needs to be posted everywhere. i'm dying to see some of the limp-wristed rebuttals. <eos>
what will sanders say? i mean this is what he has wanted but his been cucked by hillary for so long. how does he support this 5 point plan essentially part of what he campaigned for while disavoing trump. <eos>
"donald trump is issuing an ethics reform package, which is frightening." -vox <eos>
who doesn't love this? share everywhere! <eos>
omg wow this is huge. <eos>
this is pretty fucking impressive. i say that as a lefty. definitely better than anything the democrats are offering. <eos>
no establishment r would support this either. dc has never been r vs d, bernie, ron paul and trump have demonstrated that it is establishment vs non- establishment. that the msm is part of the establishment has been obvious for a long time but now only the most brainwashed lefties can deny it. <eos>
i'm a "former lefty" (aka someone who supports freedom of speech and equal opportunity but spit out the radical feminism/identity politics pill), and a trump presidency would be 100% worthwhile if these were literally the only things he accomplished in four years. <eos>
wish all the bernouts understood this. instead some get tricked by the propaganda. <eos>
the dnc needs to lose. it's the only language they'll understand. maybe, if the loss is severe enough, they will be forced to give way to more populist voices like bernie. maybe next election i'll be choosing between trump and someone like bernie - although hopefully with some fucking balls. <eos>
hmm, i wonder why the democrats will never offer something similar. hmmmm. <eos>
take a look at the leaked dnc and clinton foundation documents. now ask yourself if bernie's proposed 'campaign finance reform' would have hurt the dnc or helped them fend off political outsiders. <eos>
or any establishment candidate for that matter. <eos>
nearly every politician won't know what to do with their lives after office. no wonder they all hate him. no wonder we all love him. <eos>
trump is for the people and for the truth <eos>
he's ordained to fix the corruption in the united states caused by the bush and obama/clinton administrstions for the past 25 years....it's time the united states gets to reep the seeds of good it has sowed for 200 plus years. yes we have been bad to the world, but there's so much more good. he'll rebuild detroit and chicago and restore the fabric of the division obama has caused, with his racist tactics. he'll restore hope to our college kids, which has been raped from them with the unrealistic rise of tuition and little opportunity for jobs (i feel terrible for millenials and little hope that was robbed from them) be excited folks, it's time for our harvest. this is my prophecy...maga <eos>
yeah, tomorrow is going to be a media shit storm after the elites read this. <eos>
if this goes through, it might permanently change the way our government functions. right now, it's a conveyor belt you get on in college and get off of when you die; you never have to do anything else. this effectively destroys that process. you would have to get a real job after you leave office, which means you would need a real job before you come in. <eos>
> right now, it's a conveyor belt you get on in college and get off of when you die; you never have to do anything else. and guess who runs the colleges? it's set up this way on purpose. cultural marxist factory ----> govt ----> ???? ----> profit! <eos>
obama going back to community organizing!!!!!!! <eos>
obama is going to come after trump harder than ever. he has life after potus all planned out, he has said he wants to be the first billionaire ex president. <eos>
trumps going to beat him to it! <eos>
he's not only poking the beehive, he's grabbing it with his bear hands (ya, i did it) and throwing the fucker against the wall and clown stomping it to stop the fuckers from shitting in the honey. ps: please, oh please, president trump... stay safe. scary roads when you shine light in dark places. <eos>
this is my first time saying maga! <eos>
this is great. *this* will make america great again. you have to be a piece of shit to be against this <eos>
americans, vote this man into office. you won't get a politician to ever do this again. don't fuck this up. please. <eos>
i can picture obama right now just breaking shit with his golf club in the white house. <eos>
omfg, i love you donald!!! <eos>
after the last two videos i'm a believer. <eos>
hopefully the worst one is right before the debate on wednesday. <eos>
based on how o'keefe and breitbart handled the acorn videos we can expect each one to be more damning than the next <eos>
shit, i really hope he isn't overhyping this one. that video he released today was a lot juicier than i expected and i'm afraid if i set my expectations too high i'll just be disappointed. <eos>
must have them included. maybe that's why fox cancelled their interview with him. <eos>
i think they cancelled because they are hosting a debate on wednesday and they fear clinton will pull out. <eos>
>they fear clinton will pull out. at least that saves clinton the $200 for forcing a woman to have an abortion. <eos>
hannity is on in 35 min so we will see if he touches it. i heard to did so during his radio show today. <eos>
he did!! <eos>
hannipede! <eos>
so called "reporters" in the media should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.. this guy is what you should have all been aspiring to be like. <eos>
that one writer from the boston herald broke ranks today and wrote about how our systems of checks and balances are gone, without a watchdog media, and we are just like any banana republic. i expect him to go to the gym for some reconditioning. but i bet he was inspired to find his integrity again by this video. <eos>
i think this is the one <url> <eos>
please be hillary being racist <eos>
i am going to trump you with please be hillary being racist about obama! he would be forced to stop supporting her. <eos>
imagine if this was real <url> liberals would implode <eos>
just some anon pretending he was a reporter about to release a video of that. i don't think it's real :( <eos>
when in doubt, assume op is a faggot. <eos>
reddit will crash if hillary is on tape dropping the n bomb. <eos>
more like a cloudburst emp will wipe out the nation's power grid. <eos>
unlikely, but it would be amazing. either way it's going to be a rough debate for hillary - she can bring up the gropes, while trump swats them away as being curiously timed comeforwards, before pinning things back on her with inciting violence at rallies, abusing disabled people and making them the focal points of erratic behaviour when installed as 'protesters', and sleeping for the last week, colluding with media (debate answers!) and more. trump is going to be unstoppable going forward. <eos>
fucking sad this is what elections have come down to. the only way to win is emotional slime-slinging. democracy is fucking dead. (but yeah, you're right) <eos>
yeah, a video of hillary dropping n bombs is the only thing the general public can understand. <eos>
even then i could see her getting out of it. we need a video of her drunk on the kitchen floor screaming for someone to shit in her mouth. <eos>
according to fbi anon, she isn't using n word, but there's a video of her calling blacks disgusting and poor. says it's pretty entertaining too. as a black guy, can't wait for the rest of the world to know that bitch is racist as fuck. if they really have that video, that alone would pretty much sink her campaign, even if they don't go out and vote for trump, black people wouldn't vote for her and then that's an auto-loss for hrc as she needs the black vote to have any chance of winning. and as a by-product of her being racist against black people, most latinos wouldn't vote for her either. then many liberals/sjw's couldn't justify getting out of bed and voting for her as well if this video exists/is released. really hoping what o'keefe drops is that video. he did say last month they had a video of them disparaging black people in the worst ways, just hoping its actually of hrc. <eos>
this is the saddest realization. the general public operates on "muh feelings reee" only and only understands tweet-sized sound bites. <eos>
you have no idea (actually you probably do) how many times i've tried to explain something to someone and because 1 tiny piece of my argument wasn't 100% sound they latched onto that part and called me an idiot and just ignored me completely. it's often something simple too like statistics being 2% off or something or just worded in a way that they misunderstand or think i'm being racist or sexist or whatever (not using his proper gender pronouns) i hate being part of the pussy generation. i just want to live in a log cabin in the woods isolated from society and build gadgets like a mad scientist sidekick trope character but these lunatics keep trying to tell me that i have to care about their identity and accept everyone and all sorts of annoying stuff while they kill rural jobs forcing me to live in -*shudders*- cities. tfw le wrong generation meme life is a meme <eos>
that's correct. <eos>
just to warn you all, the ctr narrative that will be moving forward will focus heavily on o'keefe's history with the acorn videos and the planned parenthood stuff. they will, once again, be committing rinse and repeat ad hominem. their narrative is that those past videos uncovered nothing of value and were fraudulently edited and since they have come to this conclusion (of course), it stands to reason that anything james o'keefe produces for the rest of his life will fall in the same boat. be ready for this if you encounter ctr in the wild. demand proof that what's actually being shown in the video is incorrect. don't get into debates about past videos. or don't debate at all. **upvote facts. downvote fallacy.** <eos>
correct them <eos>
woo-hoo, can't wait! i'll bring the popcorn! i also love his use of the phrase 'corporate media, its so spot-on laser accurate. they aren't the main stream media, they're all puppets and propaganda mouthpieces of gigantic globalist corporations. america first! maga! <eos>
hilary: "i hate fucking niggers!!" cnn: "presidential candidate clinton reaches out to african american community by learning hip hop vocabulary" <eos>
#**my man, please! stay away from the gym equipment!** <eos>
i waited until megyn was finished up, turned on hannity at 10:00, and he had the o'keefe video playing within 60sec. this is amazing. <eos>
hannity is a god amongst cucks on fox. i seriously respect his bravery for this. <eos>
never thought i would have said this 2 years ago, hannity is the most based msm figure out there right now. trump better win or we will have to put hannity on suicide watch. <eos>
no doubt. this is the first time i've seen project veritas on msm all day. now the other networks will have no choice but to air it. <eos>
#breaking: scott foval, one of the operatives in the tapes we released today has been fired! sean hannity is reporting live now! \#birddogging \#veritas [source](<url> <eos>
hannity's power level is off the charts. well over 9000. <eos>
i'll tune in every television in my home to fox during sean hannity from here on out just to boost his ratings. he's on fire <eos>
#hannity literally calling for paul ryan to no longer be speaker of the house #mfw <eos>
hannipede and newt slaying it right now! <eos>
/u/james_okeefe_iii #you're a fucking hero <eos>
the last part is what makes it sad. we literally have all the information available in the world at our fingertips and people are still ignorant. <eos>
for all the information we have available to us, we have even more entertainment available to us. i'm a gamer kid, had an nes as my first console, and i look around today and people are *spoiled*. a piece of me dies inside every time i see a child working a tablet before they even learn how to read. their incentive path for life just got fucked. (teach your kid to read before you give them shiny objects, folks. especially shiny magic low effort boxes that stimulate the senses.) there's no incentive to care or achieve, because it's never been so cheap to entertain yourself. <eos>
trump losing the presidency will mark the beginning of the end for democracy in western society. free speech. morality. reason. all things of the past. <eos>
nobody said taking the red pill didn't come without side effects <eos>
ain't that the truth. <eos>
that was page 2 here's the entire [post..](<url> <eos>
so this is how the world ends. not with a bang, but with a like button. <eos>
they're definitely going to be going after the internet harder than they already have. <eos>
former bernout here. this is my biggest fear. i have seen the damage ctr did to the reddit landscape. hrc already owns the message on tv; if she controls the internet, every single way a future american gathers information will be state-run. welcome to pyongyang. <eos>
this is why trump voters will be frothing at the fucking mouth motivated on election day. that smug, condescending, elitist yet ill-informed hillary voter has almost no motivation. **what difference does it make?** <eos>
honestly, this is now in the hands of the international community. australia, europe, asia, you guys have to tack on millions of views. if americans wake up tomorrow morning to the project veritas video with millions of views, mentions about it on twitter, in international news, etc., then american news networks will have to acknowledge it, american viewers will become more and more curious, and it'll be just in time for the second video to come out tomorrow. i'll be honest here; i'm a bernie supporter. i don't agree with most of your views, and i probably wouldn't personally get along with a large majority of you people in real life. but god dammit, america needs you. the world needs you. get this video out to as many people as you can, and make some fucking history. <eos>
another 2 million just saw it on hannity, that's 1% of the population so far in one day! <eos>
ctr is here. i know this because we're getting instant downvotes and i can smell them. the smell of desperation. <eos>
youtube is owned by google right? wikileaks/assange said they have leaks regarding google. it's already theorized that google is working with hillary, i'm assuming that's what the leaks will eventually reveal as fact. <eos>
fbi anon was right. no way the republican leaders let shit like wikileaks and veritas slide unless they're doing the same shit. <eos>
same bosses. cucked by globalist corporate elites who want to pad their pockets and gain power at the expense of the american citizens. <eos>
she was also spot on about how if every republican out there on the trail and beating on just clinton's corruption, highlighted with trump's plans for the future, he'd be far in front. they don't even have to defend him - just list clinton's corruption vs trump's plans - easy! if someone would've told me that a candidate who received the most votes in republican history, in a field of 15 others, would have to fight his own party for the presidency, i wouldn't have believed it. <eos>
if fox won't expand hannipede to 2 hours then can we at least replace megyn kelly with her? <eos>
but the media told me clinton was an angel. shut up trumptards lolololol <eos>
she is a horrible, disgusting person folks. <eos>
"i'm not going to be channeling my husband" "bill please campaign for me while i recover from the coma trump put me in after the second debate." <eos>
you win at life. <eos>
as long as first prize is having a great america! <eos>
if any real people actually do visit her social media, maybe they will click the video and see the truth. good work! correct *their* goddamn record! <eos>
most of the comments are fucking hilarious, very few actual clinton supporters there. <eos>
i think there are very few clinton supporters in general. <eos>
saw this comment on her facebook page. i think we need to get this story to the press asap. > i worked for mrs. clinton in 2002, running arrands, mostly picking up pantsuits and crazy pills. one night, huma and mrs. clinton entered the office, locking the door behind them. mrs. clinton forced me onto the desk , overpowering me. huma blocked the entrance so i couldnt escape. it's hard to remember exactly what happened next, but there were hands in inapropriate places, heavy breathing, un-buttoning of pantsuits, and spanking. she made me call her madame president. i couldnt believe when i saw huma recording the terrible awful that was taking place. i figured she would use it to blackmail me, but turns out, she just gave it to her husband. i had supressed this memory all this time. it's amazing how a few thousand dollars can jog your memory. i have no way to prove my accusations, but if you dont believe me you support rape culture, and you hate women. <eos>
sooooooo, pretty sure it isn't against reddit rules to call for brigading cuckbook..... i'll just leave neow. <eos>
assange and o'keefe will go down as legends for destroying the clinton crime machine. <eos>
i can't wait to read my grandchildren's history textbooks <eos>
more like tablet ebooks <eos>
more like neural implants. "tank, i need a history book about the 2016 presidential election. hurry!" <eos>
#my dad posted the video. its in the hands of the masses now. <eos>
oh, thank god!!! <eos>
i thought rcp was another hrc proxy. <eos>
that's what makes it so epic! mebe they are bailing out before the shit really hits the fan! <eos>
#it's happ3ning <eos>
florida voters voting trump. fucking love you guys. <eos>
i physically up-vote every post in /r/the_donald/rising and /hot unless it is spreading misinformation. my /r/the_donald/hot is usually full of uptrumped content that made it through from /rising. <eos>
there are 15,000 centipedes on here right now. i guarantee we have way more than 3000 votes on every submission. it is the admins that are "botting" to keep us this low. <eos>
same, nothing better than seeing every rising post upvoted. feels good man <eos>
all that orange is just a fire in my heart <eos>
another great advantage is it let's you find new content faster in rising if it's not orange <eos>
all those spices and they picked salty. <eos>
idiots don't understand the concept of an upvote cannon. edit: for anyone not in-the-know, /r/the_donald built up a specific defense to brigading when it was a small sub: encouraging subscribers to upvote most worthy things on hot, rising, and new each time they visited. when the sub grew this behavior never changed, so you can reliably expect any post above some level of quality to hit a few thousand upvotes in 24 hours or less. the result: upvote cannon. <eos>
"how does /r/the_donald have more traffic than /r/[redacted]?! how are they getting more upvotes?! they're not even being paid! it has to be bots, why would they be so active for free?!" <eos>
it's dead-easy when it's literally 10,000+ of us on here at any given time, which seems hard for the 55 employees of ctr to get through their skulls. <eos>
we also upvote everyone because we know that their karma is routinely attacked by those we do not speak of. <eos>
their movement is such astroturfed bullshit that they can't contemplate the sheer darkness of our memes. sad! <eos>
#it's what 15k active members at a given time with over 230k organically grown members can do. get jealous politicucks <eos>
holy shit, r/the_donald is the hottest thing on reddit! i always upvote and i'm not even a paid bot. i'm a human who loves trump. <eos>
its called super male vitality look it up <eos>
#lets see: we have 230k readers with 15-20k active they have 3mil readers with 10-15k active we have a 7-9% ratio of activity against their 0.3-0.5%. that's roughly **twenty times** their activity. no shite we're going to have more upvotes and comments on our links. #stumped <eos>
this is...amazing lmao they think we are the bots <eos>
well, i browse from my computer and there's no downvote button. and everytime i upvote something, another wall is built which makes me happy <eos>
by this logic trump is a robot. "look at how many campaign events trump goes to and how many rallies he has!" "hillary clinton isn't even going to a quarter of the number events that he is, trump must be a robot because it's crazy how many more events trump has!" nah some people are just high energy and others are low energy. <eos>
#britpedes get to the embassy, anyone know the britpedes names who were streaming the other day? <eos>
he is not a citizen and we aren't at war with ecuador, uk, or aus. how is this legal?? :( <eos>
how is any of this shit legal? the clinton machine is corrupt, and vast. <eos>
its not. the only country that can arrest him is ecuador, and they still said they'll give him asylum. <eos>
got it: brian mentioned how ecuadorian embassy cut off his internet then casually says 'the word is he's gonna be arrested soon maybe in a matter of hours' . then the next bulletin the chick just mentions how his net was cut no news of arrest. no sources. <eos>
saw it on the feed, it's the tv equivalent of click-bait. "and rumour has it, he's goign to be arrested in mere hours????? back after this!" <eos>
we need to get ted cruz to save him right away! "follow me, assange. you need to hand over the leaks" <eos>
wieners don't care where they park it. <eos>
hopefully that parking enforcement officer doesn't go to the gym. <eos>
at first i thought julian was blowing smoke but now i'm starting to believe he may have something big. <eos>
i think he has all 33,000 of her emails. <eos>
roger stone tweeted this the other day when julian's internet was cut by ecuador: "john kerry has threatened the ecuadorian president with "grave consequences for equador" if assange is not silenced" i think there was def shit going on behind the scenes and julian was ready for it. <eos>
actually, as james o'keefe proved yesterday, it is hillary who is funding violence and hate. <eos>
i think that stein might be hoping for an indictment to run in hrc's place. <eos>
we ready <eos>
me ready <eos>
possibly hillary showing her true feelings about black people? <eos>
please be her saying the "n" word... please be her saying the "n" word... please be her saying the "n" word... <eos>
i 2nd this. as a black immigrant man, i have been waiting for her to drop this word... <eos>
i just don't think anything else will stick. sell influence? meh. mishandle classified info? i dunno. have people killed? well... trigger a massive migrant crisis in eu? but - say the "n" word??? holy shit, shes an evil criminal!!! <eos>
do we know when this will drop? <eos>
4 hours! noon eastern time <eos>
he clearly does not care about the midterms this is making me ignore <eos>
and when you resort to violence, that is the definition of terrorism... <eos>
do these people have any idea how technology works? (they don't) <eos>
so are they operating under the assumption that the only copy of the documents are stored at the embassy? i don't get it. <eos>
they are beyond naive and in panic mode. i mean podesta didn't even change his twitter or email passwords after being hacked =/ <eos>
how is this a real poll? <eos>
because it fits the narrative and will be used to "prove" the election wasn't rigged because the results matched the polls. <eos>
most polls oversample, they want trumps average to appear hes losing big, he isnt. <eos>
they're setting the polls up in her favor so when soro's machines spit out a hillary win, it doesn't look like fraud. <eos>
that's my fear, they are preparing everyone mentally for a fraudulent clinton victory. i'm pretty worried about what will happen if that is the case. we obviously can't take that lying down, but yeah it could be very ugly <eos>
i'm thinking trump is ahead nationally by +20. that's just my finger in the air personal poll. <eos>
did obama call the fbi "liars"? <eos>
and what does the fbi think of this, hmm? <eos>
i think this means all out war, expect a lot of whistle blowing in the upcoming weeks. i sure as shit wouldn't like to be called a liar by the president. <eos>
that's the best part.... they're stuck caught between pay to play, and calling the fbi untrustworthy. either way, they're in a shit position. <eos>
democrat #1: "this is fake. it never happened" democrat #2: "pff this is nothing. stuff like this happens all the time." hillary clinton: "pff again with this old thing? look, we tackled this at the time and it's a settled issue." <eos>
look, i cackled and said it's false, why are you still asking me? <eos>
damn. he is fucking desperate. #no survivors <eos>
which is it obama -- the fbi is trustworthy and cleared hillary of any wrongdoing, or they're liars and the documents are false? <eos>
we are onto you, okie doke! <eos>
first president to go to jail will be black <eos>
how long before she comes out and just endorses trump? <eos>
the road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say. these people truly think they are doing god's work, i'm sure. history will judge them most harshly... unless they decide to "correct" that record too. <eos>
i agree with this. scott adams says this phrasing is weapons grade persuasion. <eos>
i love the "drain the swamp". wonder if it is trending on twitter yet??? <eos>
brad woodhouse, president of ctr source: <url> brad woodhouse's june 30th paycheck from ctr: <url> video link: <url> --- brad woodhouse - president of americans united for change (who just fired scott foval yesterday) <url> --- **ctr receives marching orders directly from the clinton campaign** ctr openly collaborates with the clinton campaign: <url> **follow the trail** clinton campaign --> ctr --> scott foval this demands a response from ctr and the clinton campaign. --- **correct the record shares multiple employees with another super pac** correct the record shares office space with american bridge 21st century, an "opposition research" super pac. public record indicates that 8 individuals are collecting pay from both ctr and american bridge simultaneously. this is a full blown illegal shadow campaign being waged by brad woodhouse and david brock: <url> --- not to mention the other thirteen companies that share office space correct the record super pac and american bridge 21st century super pac: <url> --- **here's the full trail** clinton campaign --> correct the record --> david brock's 14 super pac's and nonprofits --> scott foval (people aren't supposed to know about him) <eos>
god youre fast <eos>
he's literally saying the fbi is lying. <eos>
this guy lol. he shits on america, pushes gun control, shoves a shitty obamacare law down our throats. then our taxes pay for the largest personal security force in the world to protect him while he plays golf and campaigns for hillary. i'm looking real hard don't see a legacy, all i see is failure <eos>
after a thorough investigation of ourselves, we find that we have done nothing wrong. <eos>
i upvoted you, whats your count! <eos>
[they're still going](<url> unbelievable <eos>
guess this is why he delayed the release 😂 <eos>
it's not even chess anymore, we kicked over the table and it's four dimensional teabagging dip dip potato chip bitch edit: <url> <eos>
but voter id cards are racist you guise!!!1 <eos>
ho-lee fuck. just watched the video <eos>
obama is implicated in voter fraud in the podesta emails <eos>
obama scheduled this right when he knew the video would be out to drown out the message, this was 100% deliberate, we know how they operate now. <eos>
he used the same tactics in 2008 per the podesta #10 drop <eos>
it's the chicago way. people keep forgetting obama was trained by the chicago machine. they are the worst. boss tweed doesn't have shit on their organized corruption. <eos>
fantastic! hoping they don't spin it. guess doj couldn't intimidate them any further. <eos>
they will decide not to at 545. <eos>
obama trapped, public on one side, fib on the other... <eos>
hear that fellas? it's the sound of dozens of ctr employees committing suicide <eos>
these and the 5 point plan he released are the reforms this country desperately needs to continue to fight corruption <eos>
this is exactly what we need to smash the washington establishment! <eos>
any congressman who doesn't vote for this should be primaried out. <eos>
(looking at you paul ryan) <eos>
fuck yes <eos>
all he needs are the states...the states can do this without congress's buy in! <eos>
where is rand paul? he's been pushing for this forever! rand is riding the back of the trump train right now and he needs to get to the front! <eos>
holy shit!!!!! flip the fucker now! <eos>
wonder how many shitlibs are sweating, wondering if they are busted and are looking at gowdy's phone number....thinking about making a deal. lol <eos>
they're reading trump's book now to get the *best* deal. <eos>
that's an admission of guilt. <eos>
they will say there is no proof. (there is) <eos>
looks like bob creamer slipped and fell on his sword. *sad trombone sound* <eos>
whoa, they're right. they're taking them out one by one. hell fucking yes. <eos>
i feel like liberals don't care. the dnc leaks caused nearly every single top level dnc official to be fired or resign and yet they still don't care. it's the undecided's that is who we are appealing to. if we can swing this election 2-3% towards trump with undecided's that will be huge. <eos>
drip, drip, drip... james said he's releasing a video every day until election day. i bet he's working his way up the chain of command to the root. everyone over there would be sweating bullets (except that they want to take everyone's guns away but theirs). remember he said his operative got invited to the white house? boom! <eos>
this confirms the fact that o'keefe's videos are legitimate. the left officially has no more arguments against o'keefe's releases. trump is going to win. period. <eos>
man this guy really came out of nowhere and did some good for the world. it takes guts and sacrifice to expose something like this especially when you know what your up against leaking it, it's definitely not for fame or fortune, unless you want to be a famous russia spy. thank you mr o'keefe, your a modern day patriot, hero of the people, and a shining light in a sea of darkness. <eos>
[i'm on it, dahnald](<url> <eos>
but obama assured me that everything is fair. <eos>
and not a peep from the fbi... <eos>
as a frequent visitor of many bars, i can confirm that i've never heard anyone talk about rigging an entire election. <eos>
i'm usually busy trying to grab pussies when i'm at the bar <eos>
just casually conspiring to incite violence at political events, or, you know, terrorism as it should be called properly. nothing to see here. <eos>
bar room talk: good locker room talk: bad got it, thanks cnn <eos>
"i *could* grab a woman and she'd be fine with it" = trump admits to sexual assault. "i *did* rig an election and pay people to incite violence at events x, y, and z as corroborated by these pay stubs which i've filed with the government." = just some casual bar room bragging. <eos>
i feel like i'm living in a twilight zone. do they realized how hypocritical they sound? <eos>
so i can say whatever i want in a bar but not in a locker. thanks cnn. <eos>
people are resigning left and right because of "bar room talk" ? <eos>
and this post is already downvoted to 0 net votes. hello ctr and /r/[redacted] :) <eos>
he said that on the tape <eos>
and this validates o'keefe's claim <eos>
exactly. people need to see it too. they need the visual confirmation, the illustration of how this extends all the way to the top. this is also the type of thing that the president needs to have to be forced to respond to, the optics alone would be incredibly damaging. it makes him appear complicit. <eos>
also, donna brazile stated that creamer had no ties to the dnc. then why were there so many visits to the wh??! <eos>
today the highway, tomorrow the whole country. <eos>
this story is more damaging to hillary than wikileaks, o'keefe, fbi, etc. it needs to be on drudge asap and it needs to go to the top. i am very serious. this can't get buried. associating a candidate with toilet paper and human feces is, as scott adams might say, a kill shot. <eos>
it's a lot more sensual and sensational, so it should catch on with the normies. <eos>
so are they going to go back and pick hillary up? <eos>
who does she think she is, dave matthews? <eos>
#cesar vargas, we watched el reporto #now you're getting el deporto <eos>
apparently still doesn't know english. <eos>
they're not sending their best, folks. <eos>
archive of his facebook post (that was linked in the tweet) in case he gets wise and realizes how stupid it is. <url> <eos>
this is the same sort of shit that turned mexico into a giant shit hole. <eos>
indiana was one of the states o'keefe sited as having "weak knee'd" republicans that would look the other way on dems committing voter fraud <eos>
**oh shit you're right! the msm must be forced to report on this!** <eos>
obama and the msm "nothing to see here! move along" <eos>
because they're using deception and it's bullshit! yes, **it is true** that there were only ever 48 reported cases in history of **impersonation fraud**. yes, that's absolutely true! only 48 times has someone claimed to be someone else so that they can vote. **but this is not the only type of fraud**. democrats have mastered the art of lie by omission, or lie by deception: of saying one true fact but lying by leaving out others. in this case in indiana, for example, it appears a democratic super pac is submitting voter registration changes so that, on election day, the people who come in to vote for republicans, will not be eligible to vote. they'll find that they don't exist in the databases of their local voting districts. that's not voting impersonation: it's voter disenfranchisement. then there's the fact that 14% of non-citizens have illegally registered to vote. again, that's not voter impersonation: that's illegal voting. by focusing only on this one **type** of "fraud," democrats are able to cherry-pick the "wording" used by donald trump, and say, "here's what voter fraud is by definition, and there's only been 48 cases of it." <eos>
creator of family guy as well. <eos>
no need to dvr family guy, terrible show made by hacks. stick to based animation like south park, and , uhm, south park <eos>
alec baldwin and that fucking seth mcfarland cunt...color me surprised. <eos>
#obama: its not true because fbi said its not true <eos>
he worked with the obama campaign in 2008. probably some fraud then, too. <eos>
i'm not impressed. some on that panel were being dismissive due to okeefes credibility or whatever. that he edits to fit the narrative. that shit is not edited. these fucking shills i swear. <eos>
exactly this <eos>
they claim it was only talk and never took place. so they are getting fired for "theorizing"about it. <eos>
they've been doing it for 50 years and you can't stop them. paraphrased, but that's what's said in the video. that's no hypothetical. <eos>
that pepe sums up my reaction exactly.. <eos>
clinton says russia is rigging our election: omg trump and russia are working together trump says the dnc is rigging elections: omg no election is ever rigged <eos>
>there has never been fraud in an election won by a democrat we need a "my sides" pepe <eos>
" as a patriot, i would feel obligated to help kill twitter. (and you wouldn’t want to bet against me.)" sounds like war has been declared <eos>
i think it's important that he mentioned fiduciary responsibility. all someone would have to do is buy a single share, and, with a good enough lawyer, could sue the board for putting political opinions above the profits of the company. <eos>
this needs to be done. throw facebook and google in there too <eos>
if you don't check his twitter now and then he is legitimately getting pissed off at ctr as an aside, i gave his book 5 stars just to offset ctr <eos>
as long as we are at it can we kill cuckbook too? <eos>
well lately i've thought of adams as being kinda cucked. not anymore. <eos>
really? the guy has been talking about trump winning for over a year, he's banging an instagram model half his age, he's sacrificed about a million dollars in speaking fee's just so he can openly talk about politics, trump and how this whole system works. he endorsed clinton in the most backhanded way possible and then endorsed trump, and then johnston... once again in a really back handed way. so he's put his reputation, and bank account on the line so he can publicly deconstruct a fight he has no skin in, all the while talking about how trump was gonna win in a landslide. besides the fact he lives in cali and is surrounded by mind controlled libs who very well might attack him. it's like every choice he made for the last year and a half has been more ballsy than anything most people have done. <eos>
knowing scott adams, he'll work on destroying twitter for two days before endorsing it and then switching to gab. <eos>
yeah, but adams has an economics degree, is a multi-millionaire businessman, and knows how to work within the system in a way that gets results in financial circles. <eos>
#to the top seriously this is a big deal, tying this scumbag to obama personally. <eos>
i doubt he's defending anything.. more like probably doing the bare minimum to not look like a completely biased asshole. <eos>
i came here to say this. these people are starting to get scared about what is going to happen after the election. the smart ones are anyway. <eos>
i'm so excited right now. every day i wake up another corrupt head rolls. <eos>
fuck anderson cooper - too little too late <eos>
god damn, shills still trying to push the narrative that the trump tapes were even close to as bad as this. they are fucking desperate. <eos>
the cynic in me says this is a trap to bottom out the polls after the debate. remember this is the washington post we are talking about. <eos>
yeah. it seems to happen each debate. except this debate crooked will be on d big time, and trump has nothing to lose. i expect it to be bloodbath. <eos>
yeah trump will definitely do fine. he figured out last time that since the moderators are just going to keep attacking him he just needs to ignore them and keep insulting hillary. it sounds stupid but they don't have any real way to stop him from doing that. <eos>
yea i predict he's going to hijack the debate and just throw out red pills to the television audience the entire time. use each 2 minute block to answer the question in 10-20 seconds, then spend 1min50s to shit on hillary like a hrc campaign bus in georgia. <eos>
but but but everyone said florida is leaning hillary! ddddd: <eos>
their current narrative is that texas, freaking *texas*, is supposed to be a swing state now. <eos>
you're going to see the polls "shift" massively in the next few weeks. up until now they've just been making shit up but they want to look accurate for the real result so they'll probably stop lying. <eos>
"we are contracted directly with the dnc"- that quote's definitely not gonna look good on prime time news lol. <eos>
just bar room talk, nothing here. --cnn <eos>
cnn is covering it. this is going to be a debate topic more than likely. we are fucking winning <eos>
o'reilly must have seen hannipede's ratings and taken the hint! <eos>
**wipe the upvotes, like with a cloth or something?** **important edit: the_donald moderators have banned me! #freesignedupfortrump** [the mods of the_donald banned me permanently for "spamming."](<url> weird, since i have seen many people make [this relevant joke about reddit censorship](<url> before (writing "[redacted]" [a bunch of times in one comment](<url> which had 14 upvotes so people seemed to find it funny), which is what i was apparently banned for. i can't reply to anybody else's posts, but can still edit. i don't want to break the rules and create a new account, so i guess today marks the high point of my the_donald career (i had the #1 most upvoted post on reddit today, and like three posts hit #1 on the_donald), and my retirement from shit-posting here. i hoped that the moderators would overturn the ban or at least downgrade to a temporary ban, since i have a deplorable shit-posting history of 7 months on here and was making a joke that many people have made before. **is this censorship because i'm such a prolific shit-poster? pressure from reddit inc. to ban me? mods are not answering modmail to give a response** **edit: raising awareness. is our mod team cucked? lots of new mods lately.** can people please submit threads, [linking to this comment](<url> as the submission link, with something like... * the deplorable shit-poster /u/signedupfortrump who posted today's 10,000+ upvoted project veritas's james o'keefe video has been banned from posting here by the_donald mods. retaliation by reddit admins? what's the explanation? * is the_donald mod team compromised? why was signedupfortrump permanently banned without recourse after posting project veritas's james o'keefe video? <eos>
it's so good to hear someone on tv speak the truth! hannity is the onmly one we watch and this is why. <eos>
fbi: we found evidence of voter fraud, thousands upon thousands of fake registrations. shredded registrations of opposing parties.. but no evidence of intent. no attorney general will take this case. <eos>
time for a coup at the fbi. <eos>
this is why the founding fathers wanted us to have guns, and the fascist left wants to take them away. <eos>
maybe that explains why he was visiting the wh so often. what the fuck is going on when convicted felons who went to prison for tax fraud are actively participating in nuclear deals with foreign terrorist backing countries? <eos>
lol trump was right when he said we have stupid leaders. our current leaders are a disgrace <eos>
oh brother, felons can't vote. but if you're a rich connected felon you can write domestic and foreign policy for the president and break every law under the frickin sun to rig the vote. does the 3 strike rule apply to rich whitey dude? and im gonna sue the asshole for ruining my morning coffee time. <eos>
im trying to decide why noones covering this. do they think that everyone will love it? does the media disagree? i heard him say it live seen no mention since. <eos>
o'keefe is at least one person who can still be called a true journalist unlike anyone from the msm (minus based hannity). <eos>
crowdsourced journalism is the new norm. we are free to tune in to whoever we want, and easily discard them for another if found fraudulent . <eos>
**but trump doesn't even have policies!!!!!** -actual shills says this all the time <eos>
theres a whole lot more creepy stuff in the email exchange..."julian: we know its you writing" "the reasons why julian’s cooperation are necessary at this stage, are beyond the scope of this email message." the scope that includes threats to his lawyers family... the tweet they ask him to send out, they're asking him to give up. this doesn't seem to have anything to do with pedophile framing <eos>
it'd be fun for an october surprise if he said fuck this, vote trump. they can take my house at the lake. trump can buy me a new one. <eos>
i can't believe we witnessed the astounding con hillary, and her dnc thugs, pulled on bernie supports. took them for every last penny. disgusting! <eos>
i know he sold his soul but i still feel kind of sorry for poor, befuddled bernie. i especially feel sorry for all his voters who lost their votes because of crooked. <eos>
... or their money. many spent their last penny because they had hope. now it funds the worst possible option. <eos>
if the gop is next then we will drain that swamp too. the people are sick of this shit and we don't care if you are democrat or republican--slime is slime. <eos>
amen! both partys are for themselves and not the people! <eos>
drain the swamp isn't a partisan statement. <eos>
lol, cucks like rubio, paul ryan, and john mccain are no different than the democrats at the end of the day. they may not organize voter fraud like dems but they are still gloablists. at least ted cruz serves a purpose and triggers/obstructs shitlibs like a boss in the senate. i don't care if he is a booger eating weasel with the most punchable face ever. <eos>
> tomorrow it could be us your godamn right. just what are you hiding little marco? <eos>
i knew he was just pretending to be cucked for a few days. <eos>
damn they coordinate it down to the words on the signs their fake protestors use, all at the top of the food chain of the clinton campaign. crazy. <eos>
"i can't recall" <eos>
paul ryan should call congress into session immediately and begin impeachment proceedings against obama, lynch, comey, and clinton. that's what he would do if he wanted a republican victory. <eos>
problem is paul ryan is one of them and needs to be impeached aswell <eos>
i feel like this guy resembles most of america. blah blah blah blah sexism trump. he must be bad. lemme see this the_donald shitshow. hahah, stupid pepes... what idiots. whats this leak thing. hmmmm....... huh, whats this video.... uhhhhhh......... whats this image? um so these weapnoized fools debunked a """scandal""" that i havent even heard of yet? wtf........... ***red pilled*** <eos>
literally joined this sub in the beginning to see the dank memes for laughs and now i can stop talking about saving america to my friends **send help** <eos>
same story for me months ago. didn't care about politics much, kinda liked the bern. came here since i started seeing a lot of reddit make fun of the dom. *two days later* "wtf i'm red pilled now" <eos>
hahaha yeah. wtf when did i get red pilled so hard. i feel like someone dropped a pill in my drink without my knowledge, but instead of something horrible, i've woken up in a mansion with a ferrari outside and i have proof of ownership for both. <eos>
i have the stupidest grin on my face. tldr: >i thought you were all a bunch of psychotic autistic retards but you actually managed to make that work for you and may have uncovered and exposed the most corrupt government institutions in the history of the usa. good job #i love it. maga <eos>
perfect summary <eos>
the emails or the fact that she deleted them is not important. what was in the emails is important. this is how it works. 1. take donations to clinton foundation in the name of charity 2. take money in the form of speaking fees 3. become secretary of state 4. return favors to donors 5. your email communications hold proof of this collusion 6. set up email in private server to hide said communication 7. public gets to know you are using private email 8. destroy said emails 9. have fbi and doj declare you innocent. <eos>
get this man a coat! welcome aboard the train! no brakes! <eos>
lmao can't believe how casual he was about it. shit acting. <eos>
chris cuomo is legit one of the worst propagandists out there. <eos>
the guy is so flippant about it. they're not even trying... <eos>
could it be any more obvious? the sarcasm is too real at the end. <eos>
they must be shitting themselves about what the real polls are showing to resort to these kind of tactics. his horrible acting is something memes are made of btw!! <eos>
at this point, a bombshell would be that she didn't send classified information. <eos>
term limits and a ban on lobbying. the two must go hand in hand, no compromise. <eos>
remember what you get from wikileaks you get from us. <eos>
i remember when carter was up by like +15 then reagan swept the country. <eos>
"remain" was up by 4 before the vote :) :) :) <eos>
literally hours before the vote <eos>
# saint ronald <eos>
this and other reasons is why i don't believe the polls. there are three kinds of people online right now. those who hate both, hose who hate trump and those who love trump. the amount of people that actually like hillary just isn't reflected any where in the real world. if the race was really as close as they say her rally's ought to be bringing people. her social media followers should be tied with trump but she's trailing my millions. even here on reddit our subreddit is over 200k more subscribers than hillary. i'm not going to lie and say i'm not nervous but the media is clearly not a trust worthy source of information. <eos>
if this holds true, there is no amount of voter fraud that could stop the donald. when he wins, it will take back all the frustration and anger i have had over the last 8 years. i will literally jump for joy. <eos>
i expect the left to lose their shit, but in all honesty the level of happiness, hope (not obama "hope"), and excitement i'll have will be off the charts. im throwing a party nov. 9. <eos>
this was an online poll from october 11. op is a bundle of sticks. <eos>
wow 25,000 people poll, these other polls do not even reach 1000! on a side note, i heard wayne dupree yesterday afternoon and his guest said in georgia early voting trump is getting 30% of the black vote! trump ftw <eos>
it's an online poll from oct 11 <url> <eos>
yeah thats why it says not a scientific poll at the bottom. i think op is making up the story in the title. <eos>
as a man, it is reassuring that all the guys in the locker room love and talk pussy, and not voter fraud. <eos>
when even ted cruz takes trump's side, you know you done goofed! <eos>
cruz hates democrats. he has his faults, but he's consistently been one of the few republicans will the balls to attack them back. <eos>
the madman actually shut down the government for a while. he knows how to get things done <eos>
#dahnald. deploy the cruz missiles! <eos>
shit...spam it to the top if you gotta. also we need to get this out to the donald and okeefe to help spread the word send this to donald jr too (i don't twatter or i would) <eos>
#tweet it out, get some attention on this. even if it's nothing, eyes are needed on this. don't let her cheat again! <eos>
**to the top!!!** <eos>
the old folks always vote, yet they are the most tuned into the msm all day. the good thing is for many their life experiences help them to smell a rat. but for many many others they trust the newscasters implicitly and think trump is a bad man. they haven't heard how how bad hillary is. any ideas to reach this group better? <eos>
this. my dad (a guy in his mid sixties) thinks hillary and trump are both "conceited idiots" and that trump is treating the election as though it's a reality tv show. he listens to the radio on full blast to work, the news during every meal, and reads the newspaper (and told me to read the bs they "reported" on trump). i'll try bringing up his pledge to reform the government but i'm afraid he won't take it (or me) seriously, since the msm brainwashed him into not taking anything related to trump seriously. on a lighter note, my younger sibling is voting for the first time, and for trump! together we will maga!! <eos>

it's amazing that these "journalists" initial reaction isn't to find out if voter fraud/collusion could be happening, but immediate jump to denial and ridicule. we are living in some 1984 orwellian shit right now fam. <eos>
what's worse is the president doesn't even show concern of the *possibility* of voter fraud. i would expect a leader to say something like "these videos are deeply disturbing and we're going to get to the bottom of it" but instead we get hand waving and dismissal <eos>
america forgot what a real leader looks like. trump has restored my faith that they still exist <eos>
link: <url> i seriously hope o'keefe is hiding out somewhere for his personal safety, and changing locations often. it's not a joke anymore with what they tried to pull with assange. when he throws down a potus gauntlet, things are getting serious. edit: <url> donated $50 to the patriot to buy some time for his security protection. who will match me? <eos>
they will throw some bs charge at him shortly - likely related to recording people without permission in the state of fl. hopefully he has taken precautions to keep the videos being released, even without him. <eos>
they say he is a criminal every time they mention his name. but bob cramer has a felony and visited the whitehouse over 300 times. many times to meet with obama directly. i have a feeling this will come up at the debate. <eos>
all 340 meetings between potus and creamer were to talk about the bulls. <eos>
fbi anon: "keep pressing for more info on the cf" draintheswamp <eos>
early vote is about to start in texas. bet the dems were trying to fuck with the gotv operations - essentially rigging by sabotaging the campaign. don't worry though, texas is solid red and the texas dems are retards - look at "battleground texas" and how badly they fucked up trying to put abortion barbie in office. the pissed away millions of dollars <eos>
>later, a spokesperson for the san antonio police department said it did not appear the attempted break-in was politically motivated. officers said the suspect has a history of breaking into buildings and there was no evidence he knew the office he was targeting was being used by the trump campaign. the double blind. pay a homeless person $50 to commit a crime. the homeless person sees money and does not question why. <eos>
"i'm sure we'll find illegal activity in there!" no, democrats -- we aren't as crooked as you are. <eos>
he got that from some chairman from that company, then forwarded it to 2 people from the campaign. disgusting. also, there's the old one of his brother asking him if hillary was going to shit on the pharma sector that week, followed by a massive sale of millions of shares. <eos>
look into his holdings in joule as well, he owned 75,000 shares in that company which was also receiving money from a russian state investment group. podesta later transferred the shares into a shell company to hide the fact that he owned them from regulators. <eos>
"rules are for the little people". <eos>
i don't know. the sec can be pretty bad ass about insider trading. unless they're as politicized as the fbi... <eos>
this brings up an important point for all the centipedes out there. #do not assume people know things. likely they don't, so repeat repeat repeat repeat. its what trump does, its why he's so good. his speeches are all on repeat, and while people mock him, it shows that even on repeat things will get missed. because i can tell you ive heard him say this in at least 3 rallies and numerous interviews. <eos>
and [scott adams](<url> is about one day from going to war with twitter. <eos>
its good to have zodiac killer on our side. <eos>
complyin' ted is best ted. <eos>
or we could just act like we're trading with them and vote trump anyways... <eos>
john stubbs. founder of republicans for clinton. scumbag fucker. <eos>
there are more <url> <url> <url> <eos>
>trump is a good guy. he's done so many good things without fanfare. just look at his family. he is a great man. <eos>
seriously though- this can't fall through, it would look bad. they had to have already tested bill's dna from somewhere. no way would they pursue this and end up being fake. <eos>
one of the pences did the legwork... it's legit... he gave the time machine back to the main pence... <eos>
the fact that danney keeps saying over and over all he wants to do is meet his father and shake his hand and let his kids meet their grandfather makes me think there really is something here. he doesn't come across as a money or fame whore looking for a pay day <eos>
don: "why did you make statement "xyz" hill: " i didn't" don: " it's playing on facebook right now. everyone is watching." <eos>
say it with me everyone. #weaponized. autism. <eos>
get this to the top, 4chan prophet today said exact same thing, the trump camp is planning something big. <eos>
also saw this on 4chan. there have been several hints to something "country altering" today. maybe he will do this during his fb live event in 30 mins? <eos>
that phrase "country altering" was the same language on 4chan. sounds more credible that two sources within hours are using the exact same langauge. your right, we need to be ready and have the hashtag ready to rock.#shedidwhat remember <eos>
i want to believe. <eos>
#last time i was this excited when i was 10 years old and it was christmas. <eos>
well, considering it's 4chan, there's about a 10% chance it actually happens and a 90% chance some guy is gonna be sitting there at 9:46 like "hah i got them to do it. trolled!" either way i will be amused. <eos>
i've heard something, but i'm literally too scared to post it. i'm waiting to see if they prompt it. <eos>
i'll provide you with the "bombshell." donald will inform everyone that i am the owner of hillary's soul. so, it's not really that much of a bombshell. sorry. <eos>
upvotes are fine all you have to do is disable sub styles its not coming from reddit its coming from the sub directly i assume so it doesnt look like things are getting bot voted at high traffic times and hopefully not to try and make us look like victims <eos>
that was so horrible! <eos>
hillary also let it slip that it takes 4 minutes from order to launch for our nukes. that shit's ***top secret.*** edit: <url> there you go folks. lock her up. edit2: <url> <eos>
well classified / confidential / top secret. it's all just so confusing. <eos>
hillary also let it slip that it takes 4 minutes from order to launch for our nukes. that shit's ***top secret.*** <eos>
#she is dodging questions left and right * wikileaks * money from countries that treat people like shit * e-mails * pay to play #disaster! <eos>
he definitely almost lost control a few times, but since he kept them on topic, it was perfect. trump took it to hrc though, she never defended herself, she just pivoted each time under pressure. and she wishes this was radio, she looked awkward. <eos>
he was very fair. i thought he'd be a bigger dick to trump. i was happy. <eos>
he took both candidates, allowed them to say their points then gave them counterpoints by saying "okay but you also said...". very balanced for both candidates. 7/10 balanced performance. <eos>
oh fuck off, he was fair tonight. let's not become a one-sided bullshit echo chamber. <eos>
no intent to say that tho. - fbi <eos>
not sophisticated enough to realize that was classified. <eos>
when i heard it i thought wait that can't be public <eos>
<url> look: damage control? <eos>
that was my first thought hearing that. i hardly expected that to be common knowledge. <eos>
i sure as fuck didn't know beyond speculation and i was screaming for her to stfu. wtf? <eos>
i am a former holder of a ts/sci and i didn't know that. <eos>
extremely careless <eos>
#russians are grateful <eos>
**send that shit nonsecure** <eos>
treason. <eos>
they tweeted this: <url> #damage control? <eos>
this is false, while googling for the nuclear response time in google :d i found this about the deployment chain >presumably, by the time the potus got into that position, they gained the scruples not to launch a needless nuclear annihilation of another nation. that said, there's a chain of command that involves the secretary of defense who could refuse to relay the order (his codes —or those of the asst. sec. defense in his absence— are required to launch) and then quickly call the cabinet and congress to report that the potus had gone crazy. the cabinet can declare the president unfit in a letter to congress. >furthermore, there's a "must notify" part of the nuclear protocol that requires the dod and whomever else inside the white house to notify senior leaders of the us government in the event of a nuclear launch. these leaders would include (and presumably not be limited to), speaker of the house, president pro temp of the senate, majority/minority leaders of both houses of congress, the chairperson of the various oversight committees that are tied to war (appropriations, defense, intelligence, energy). the chain of command, that requires the secretary of defense and others to relay such an order is robust enough to handle such a statistically-impossible scenario of a "rogue president" ordering a launch. from: <url> <eos>
im almost positive thats classified...if she said minutes thats general enough..but 4 minutes? thats a pretty accurate number <eos>
can someone find proof of it being classified? if so, that's really the nail in the coffin. edit: i removed the photo to previously deleted comment as per op commenter request. <eos>
now they know how close their slbm systems have to be. <eos>
i work with sensative stuff and i can most certainly tell you, for her to say "4 minutes" is very very specific and i'm 99.9999% sure that it was highly illegal. <eos>
she didn't intend to say that, it was trump's fault. he got her so worked up! <eos>
hillary: "i don't recall saying that" fbi: "ok, good enough for us, we recommend no charges" <eos>
she did,holy shit she did. <eos>
#classified (ts)?! <eos>
this made me create a login and start posting. i watched the cnn recap of the debate and they cut trump's answer and only showed the viewers the "i'll keep you in suspense" part. they then cut to clinton and showed her full 2 min response. pissed me off. <eos>
note that if you kill a pregnant woman your charged with two counts of murder. just saying. <eos>
i really can't wrap my head around it, and ignorant of me not to know, i thought it was the first trimester with some allowance under special circumstances...but not 8-9 months. <eos>
#nottheonion tl;dr - they are playing identity politics again. here's a summary of their reason why it's not cool. 1. slavery was legal. black people were enslaved. <-- still are on democratic welfare plantations 2. enslaved africans were considered to be three-fifths of a person. 3. only white people were considered to be people. 4. only white men who owned property could vote. 5. lgbt couples couldn’t get married. <-- clinton doesn't believe in this #wikileaks <eos>
# quality shit post from a quality berner! <eos>
with a shit post like that, you know the transformation is complete <eos>
but do you disavow? <eos>
yes. some of trump's policies don't quite align with me but doesn't matter. we have 1 establishment to topple. kinda cold in here ain't it? <eos>
give this man a coat! <eos>
i was hovering over the "deport" button... great shit-post, based patriot! <eos>
this post needs to be on the front page. this is literally like the korean central news agency saying something negative about kim jong-un. <eos>
holy shit. the post is tearing her apart in this one. maybe this is the point where they try to spin it back to reality and allow themselves to look good when trump wins. i'll give them the click, but i won't forgive them for lying over and over again. <eos>
super important e-mail in that it demonstrates hillary's poor judgement in the face of influence money and foreshadows how a clinton administration would be indebted to bad actors and criminal regimes. the "same issues we discussed" mentioned by mook in this email is a veiled reference to morocco's many human rights abuses. her campaign staff is rightly concerned about the optics of the clinton foundation/clinton global initiative accepting huge sums of money from a regime that so frequently violates international law and acts in a way that you'd expect the clinton foundation to publically rebuke. i guess $12 million is just too much money to allow morals, ethics, and the best interests of american citizens to intervene. hillary and bill ended up travelling to morocco. following the event, her judgement and character were eviscerated by normally friendly media outlets: (<url> <url> the intercept explores how morocco is exploiting hillary's weakness for huge donations, and her desire to be president, to support their own geopolitical interests here: <url> <eos>
we can't be like bernie bros and say all polls are bullshit except for the ones that have trump ahead. the way i see it any and all polls are just hearsay and easy to manipulate, the only answer is more shit posting and standing up for trump. then you americans have to do your job and actually go vote! <eos>
wow this is definitely a quality i look for in a president!! why have trump for president when we can have a sociopath?? <eos>
i think its worse than that. i think she's a psychopath. podesta emails showed numerous times where staff needed to instruct her when to smile because she cannot understand what's happening. she's also openly laugh about murder plenty of times, most memorable is the "we came, we saw, he died". <eos>
hrc in her mind: "man those were some good times" <eos>
she's a robot. she was told to laugh whenever trump raises a good point to dismiss it as stupid, but this isn't a conspiracy or a theory; it is a fact. <eos>
everybody is acting all offended with pussy grabbing meanwhile i'm here saying to myself what a cunt this woman is. <eos>
yeah it was removed quick too. this site is trash. my days on it are numbered. <eos>
literally only come here for t_d now. was just supprized when opening the site this morning, i saw anti-ctr on the front page. i guess all the sjw's were in bed, no need to get up early if ya don't work 😂 <eos>
undelete thread: <url> please bring awareness to this! to the fucking topppp <eos>
stupid cunt can't even wear a flag pin <eos>
wow, those twitter replies are just the worst. ctr out in force. <eos>
fuck the msm and clinton campaign spin. all that matters is the truth and not how it was obtained. <eos>
this actually helped me see the ecuador internet issue in a different light. they weren't cutting off his internet in an attempt to silence him, but rather prove that the leaks are not being published from within the embassy. i'm sure that was being used as a justification to remove julian from the embassy by other governments. <eos>
i think a lot of people who like stein also prefer trump to hillary. the stakes are high for this election. <eos>
you'll see some jill stuff here floating in the top of the sub, she seems to be an honest, decent person we could get along with. while we may not agree with some of her policies, we respect the fact that she put's america first. we'd love to have a future in this country where jill, and people like her will have a voice, but that can only happen if trump wins to topple the establishment. <eos>
> we'd love to have a future in this country where jill, and people like her will have a voice, but that can only happen if trump wins to topple the establishment. nailed it. <eos>
wow. your post was extremely moving and genuine. i was hoping you were my mom when i read this just now. thank you for putting the country before corruption and extreme carelessness. i only hope we can find what common ground we have to make this country better and destroy the washington cartel! <eos>
welcome aboard! i actually voted for jill in the previous election. ~horseshoe theory is in effect~ <eos>
important note....he's on the trump train now... #no brakes <eos>
> implying russia didn't already have copies of everything hillary knows <eos>
we should stop depicting putin as the enemy, hillary is more of a threat to global peace and is considerably more evil. <eos>
exactly. russia is no angel, but trump is on the right track when he's willing to work with them on shared goals. all hillary says about russia is no no no and bad bad bad <eos>
<url> <eos>
but trump said pussy! /s <eos>
winning cnn focus groups? this is yuuuuuge <eos>
he even won a cnn focus group? holy crap. no brakes! <eos>
he has predicted correctly every election since bill clinton's first term. nate feces wishes he had this man's prowess. <eos>
this guy's model is based around primary turnout and who won which states in those primaries, not media polls. nate bullshit is basically a poll aggregator. the guy's a fraud. failed at the brexit. failed at the uk election. failed at the midterms. in all instances, the polls were inaccurate. after the 2014 midterm he even wrote an article about polls being biased towards democrats. he never changed anything to account for it though. <eos>
> running the model on earlier campaigns comes up with the correct outcome for every race since 1912, except the 1960 election. (adjusts tin foil hat) oh, that's interesting. 1960 is the year the mafia rigged the vote in illinois and lbj rigged the vote in texas in favor of jfk. <eos>
exactly. they legitimately stole illinois and texas (wow, listening to alex jones he literally stated this exactly as i typed it. we are on a wavelength, centipedes, it is a winning wavelength!) edit: it's not "tin foil hat" territory, even wikipedia reports that those states were stolen. <url> <eos>
yes!!! gay black male here for trump also!!! welcome!!! <eos>
thank you! all of these responses are giving me the chills. i honestly can't say i've ever been so politically inspired <eos>
lord, please help me..i don't know what to do with all of this energy. <eos>
spread ittttttttttttttttttttttt! <eos>
what's up my fellow masshole!!! maga <eos>
we have the best lesbians don't we, folks? just the best! why do you not want more jihadists in this country who want to behead you because of who you love? bigot! <eos>
gay marine here, you ain't alone toots <eos>
this needs to be released now. more people are voting everyday. remember it took time to shove the last videos down msm's throats. <eos>
he better get to releasing it all quickly because it's useless after the election if she wins, they'd never prosecute their own slimy agents. <eos>
in north korea, there is one radio station, and personal radios have no tuning knob. cnn can't wait for their chance... <eos>
they better be fucking spicy <eos>
fbi anon was telling the truth! <eos>
send this to gowdy. he needs to see this. <eos>
i sent to both gowdy and chaffetz via twitter, but not sure they actually check that. edit: i am about to leave office, i could not send off these forms, got address validation errors, if another centipede can do it, that would be great. maga <eos>
worst part is... trump wasn't being hyperbolic.. this literally happens. stoning people to death, hanging them by cranes, and tossing people off buildings and she's fucking smirking?!? <eos>
i'm sure she was told to laugh off trump's statements. apparently, they forgot to tell her not to laugh about this one. <eos>
remember when hillary read the word "sigh" off the teleprompter? the more i see her, the more i'm convinced she's a robot. everything about her comes across as fake and rehearsed. <eos>
lmao great point. <eos>
or your spouse's attorney breaks into the room, tells you it's illegal to read the phone contents and tells you that they will tell you the truth after taking away the evidence. <eos>
you guys realize that right now, tim kaine, donna brazile, and the rest of the clinton campaign are shitting themselves, right? this kind of thing is what julian assange was talking about 10 years ago. you throw them into disarray when you continually leak stuff like this. this is incredibly damaging even if what they post isn't a "bombshell". <eos>
assange really is a master tactician. i'm positive history books will write about him at great lengths and regard him as a master of his time. <eos>
their "kill shot" from the 3rd debate was call trump a dictator cause he said he would wait till the election if he would accept the results. democrats are so dumb they made "the system isn't rigged, trump is a crazy dictator!" as their main talking point from the 3rd debate when that is the #1 thing americans are talking about this election. #totally incompetent! <eos>
i think trump already knows what's in the rest of veritas videos. he deliberately said what he did to get the media buzzing about it. this was a forecasted move, and it worked. all of these people are talking about how crazy he sounds, and then verita/wikileaks dumps emails and videos corroborating his "conspiracy" theory. i know there is already much evidence of fraud, but none directly implicating hrc. i think trump knows there is evidence. he just baited the entire msm into falling for it. i expect many tactical nukes incoming. maybe 1 or 2 tsar bomba's closer to elections with massive blast radii. <eos>
i need to see my doctor. this erection has lasted way longer than four hours. <eos>
man, i get nervous when a customer at my work asks to talk to my manager. thinking about what they're going to be talking about without me knowing. can you imagine seeing some shit like that about yourself from wikileaks? i wouldn't be able to sleep, probably ever again. <eos>
i love wikileaks! <eos>
of course it is. thank you for asking. they're undocumented voters. <eos>
to suggest that voter id laws are racist is, in and of itself, a racist statement. you're basically saying poc are somehow unable to get ids, because what? they're not smart enough? not motivated enough? too removed from normal society? if you can't be bothered to procure an id, don't bother voting. period. <eos>
"mrs. clinton, would you care to comment about wikileaks?" "it was, uh...it was...it was the russians!!, yeah, yeah, the russians....17 intelligence agencies all say it's russia because i said so, so it's russia.....russia, russia, russia....17 intelligence agencies, russia........ totally not an arbitrary number, russia.....oh, by the way....we totally need a no fly zone over syria to instigate a war with russia." - hrc <eos>
this guy is seriously such a badass! i think he deserves everyone's undivided attention from here on until we exalt the god emperor to his throne. <eos>
james will have to be patient. they'll have to get the correction cleared through the dnc first. <eos>
/u/james_okeefe_iii i pray to god you have your schedule locked down to do maximum damage. votes are already being cast and some of them are going to crooked. she must be stopped! <eos>
we need a real kill shot. people are suffering from "scandal fatigue". <eos>
> scandal fatigue amazingly, until crooked hillary ran for the presidency, i had yet to hear or see the juxtaposition of those words. <eos>
donna has been shit canned before; it is probably a resume enhancer to tell the truth. what we need are hand cuffs! <eos>
that's how you know we're on the right side of history. the dnc/globalists (and the rnc too) need to be culled. <eos>
in truth they're right, that's exactly what obama/shillary/soros are doing. wikileaks can't change that on it's own, it needs us for action. we are patriots, born and bred, and we will not allow the scumbacks to steal the election and attempt a coup on freedom. wikileaks is giving us the cold, hard truth so we wake up and not let this happen. a huge positive for example is that thread about all the county's with voting machines getting suspended etc. us finding connections with the leaks and forcing it into the public eye is what changes it. don't be depressed, instead realize that your resolve is indeed necessary and you are right to be angry, you are right to prevent these criminals from taking our country with their foul, cheating ways. edit: operation stop soros - #stopsoros is right above our heads apparently, a super-mega sticky! <eos>
soros owns the voting machines <eos>
lock her up! <eos>
hillary really has no sense of huma <eos>
"she said 'pardon me'" great line <eos>
right? works on a couple of different levels there. took me a second. hillary understood immediately. <eos>
when she laughs at the end of the clip, that is the most genuine expression i have ever seen her make. <eos>
"oh i get it! because i'm a criminal!" *cackle cackle cackle* <eos>
hillary got a belly laugh from that one. <eos>
holy fuck this one will stick. and i don't even know what the big guy said. <eos>
he was seriously killing it with great joke after great joke taking shots at hillary, nothing too hurtful, and then just pivoted into some real shit about hillary being so corrupt she got kicked off the watergate committee, and he just kept going harder, talking about "look at hillary in public here, pretending she doesn't hate catholics" and people were squirming and there were some boos but he kept his foot on the jugular bringing up haiti and wikileaks and just absolutely destroyed her. <eos>
lets get on this!!!!! <eos>
anon was able to compile a [list by county for arizona](pastebin.com/wfjtmltv) only. states still needed: * dc * florida * illinois * louisiana * michigan * missouri * new jersey * nevada * oregon * pennsylvania * virginia * washington * wisconsin that's everything in the pastebin, as you can see it doesn't add up to 16. still, ~~whatever progress can be made or help you can lend either to improving the list of numbers or~~ *(edit: list is complete, see banner post on front page) making calls yourself is needed. we can stop the fix before it happens. **edit** formatting fixed, also found the two missing states: * california * colorado **for those who are unaware** this is the banner post on the front page of the subreddit, [operation stop soros](<url> [here](<url> is an infographic pulled from the chans to help spread the truth of soros' tricks to normie friends and family members. <eos>
what's funny is that this is 100% true. she really did get canned from the watergate committee for unethical behavior. <eos>
it was like trump's version of the red wedding. <eos>
[final form trump](<url> <eos>
he was getting booed, but he knew us more important folk at home were applauding him. he takes the punches for us. <eos>
important to note: you see trump walk straight out while clinton laughed and chatted with "friends" afterwards. those are not people he cares about, he needed to seem like a good sport at first to people watching it at home. <eos>
i agree. screw those uppity elites that are now freaking out. he nailed it. the media will be showing all those points tomorrow criticizing trump but they're too stupid to realize that they will be reminding everyone of shillarys failures <eos>
omfg. that was his best performance yet. savage af. you could feel the douche chills in the room. camera holds on hillary were epic. and the butthurt boos from presumably the press...oh so good. <eos>
he shat on everyone and didn't give a fuck kek <eos>
i'm glad trump didn't pretend to be a part of their elitist club. you can tell he was deeply hurt at the start that he considered most of them friends and as soon as he decides he doesn't want to be a part of their club any more they call him every name in the book. trump crucified them and i'm glad he did almost everyone in that room is fake as fuck. this was for us the real people and you can bet he swayed a lot of people tonight. <eos>
exactly! trump knows these people inside out. he knows how crooked they are and doesn't want their support or money. that's a good thing. folks, trump will not be bought or even rented. he's running for the american people and them alone. <eos>
and this is a bad thing? <eos>
to a chair-sniffing media type? yes. to the rest of us who wish to succeed based on our works and not simple for attending the right parties? no. this right here is the best illustration of the disconnect between the "elite" and us "common" folk i've ever seen. <eos>
or maybe it was the elites resentment that he now wanted their support to help the common man. they sure loved him when they asked for and received his money. <eos>
the booing at the end showed how disconnected these elites are to the masses. they think they are so sophisticated and above us all. <eos>
why is this a surprise? trump said it himself, the room was full of her campaign staff, the heads of the msm. people who have put every effort at their disposal to discredit and slander him. this reporter is but a shill, albeit a professional one. <eos>
