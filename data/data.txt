[stream without all the stupid pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sugxduymxbm) <eos> [from todays event...](https://i.sli.mg/4oulff.jpg) i am not worthy. <eos> thanks for posting ~ <eos> putin and farage on the sidelines, hahaha! <eos> based hindu bros. <eos> this is awesome! <eos> streamer is annoying <eos> i had a dozen maga seizures trying to watch the live portion. <eos> this is the bollywood version. <eos> holy fuck the guy overlaying all the stuff is fucking hilarious <eos> oh look, a religion i disagree with but am ok with. why? because they are not actively trying to blow up americans. <eos> hindu-americans are magaing per default. <eos> i'm glad someone was covering it, but that stream was fucking shit tbh <eos> this isn't even live lol, it's looped <eos> trump spoke at 2 packed rallies and 1 invited event today. so much high energy! #no brakes <eos> wait am i watching live satellite news? <eos> wait...obama said he wasn't qualified to work at a 7-11 <eos> :') <eos> what the hell! does donald have a personal sst? <eos> my people! lol overwhelming majority of indian americans love trump! i didn't know until a gathering where i usually keep a low profile. then start hearing these 50+ year old indian men saying red pilled as fuck things. warmed my heart :) <eos> indians are more blunt than trump <eos> you can really tell trump loves americans. <eos> you can really tell hillary hates americans. <eos> hell yeah <eos> how many million indians live in america? <eos> took off wiki: 3,443,063 (including multiracial) 1.0% of the u.s. population (2014 census bureau estimate) <eos> thanks <eos> got banned from the chat for asking the streamer to remove the pictures and gifs they continued to mess around with over the stream. <eos> i think its hilarious but i can see how it can be annoying though <eos> this is definitely one of the crappier streams of trump, it doesn't do him justice - the whole thing might as well be a gif - make streams great again! <eos> dammit, where the hell does he get that energy, he just did a fucking rally in bangor. <eos> and new hampshire before that! <eos> he gets the energy because the other option is the joke---rrrr---hillary. trump is batman. <eos> from god, he is doing the lord's work. <eos> from bangor to bangalore, the don is unstoppable. <eos> for thousands of years peasants prayed to a god to save them. their efforts were scattered, and deverting focus to many gods. but none came. until now. information merchants trained autistics to focus their attention into creating meme magic. it is with the power of meme magic that the god emperor can maintain an such vigorous stamina. the real questions is can the autistics be brought to heel when trump reaches his true form? <eos> i doubt huma would ever allow killary to speak to hindus. <eos> yay it's indian ivanka again! <eos> damn that girl is hot as fuck. <eos> based hindus!!!! locker room talk: i would love for a hot indian chick to teach me some kama sutra. <eos> is he praising kek? <eos> it's the donald! <eos> wow. so busy today! <eos> are those chicken tendies on the podium? <eos> somosas... indian tendies. <eos> omg so yummy!!!! <eos> go trump! <eos> he nailed it for an indian audience. all we care about is lower taxes since most indians are small business owners, and getting rid of radical islamic terrorism since we have been victims of those snakes. he spoke mainly for these two issues and nailed it. <eos> absolutely! <eos> clinton is for lower taxes if you are a global corporation offshoring jobs to slave labor wage countries & donate a shitload to the clinton foundation. <eos> hey, are you indian? what do you think of modi? i can't quite figure the guy out. <eos> he's pretty good. not perfect, but miles better than the opposition. he's probably gonna win a second term. <eos> omg putin, my sides! <eos> tendies on the podium <eos> somosas... indian tendies. <eos> just logged in. kek'd over apu and putin on the screen. <eos> apu? never heard of him...that looks like steve barnes <eos> here's the full thing (without tiny putin, which kind of makes it worse imo) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzypk2bgmpy <eos> yep that's the one i am watching <eos> the tiny putin is funny though. so stupid and it's to trigger the shills and ctr <eos> bureaucratic trimming.... this is a new one! <eos> a bureaucratic diet. <eos> sounds more presidential than "fire the crooks". <eos> best friends with india!!!!! <eos> i fux with the hindus heavy fam <eos> based indians are our brothers in the war against radical islam! <eos> the hindus hate muslims way, way more than any white person can muster. <eos> muslims used the silk road as a buddhist murdering highway. i don't know much about hindu religious history but it's easy to assume they got fucked as well. <eos> and vice versa. indian-pakistani hatred is ***legend***, there was even a war fought in the 1970s. india beat the crap out of pakistan. <eos> there were 3 wars, might be another one soon <eos> yeah, i wouldn't rule it out, either. time to batten down the hatches. <eos> wanna bet? deus vult!!! <eos> don't forget our based sikhs! <eos> i really love our based sikhs. and our based indians. and every american who wants to #maga! <eos> putin clapping <eos> love the little putin clapping all the time lmao <eos> love the samosas <eos> when it was advertised, they were saying trump would be at this event for 4 hours. he is circulating as we speak. big big fan of hindu! <eos> yeah he's gonna be like talking a shitload to the hindus outside of that short speech he gave <eos> feed without comments https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=share&v=xzypk2bgmpy <eos> thank you come again <eos> why do they have putin clapping on the steam <eos> to troll ctr <eos> hindus love trump. there was a huge hindu celebration on his [birthday](http://i.imgur.com/ly3mhtm.jpg) in india. <eos> because hindus are based af. has anyone ever been bombed for eating a cheeseburger? <eos> at least when the extremist hindus go nutty they go toe-to-toe and riot/attack radical muslims, not other faiths or other people outside of india <eos> hahahahaha tiny clapping putin. indian women ... skin tone so beautiful. big league. <eos> indians love trump <eos> goddamn indian women are stunning! <eos> indian ladies have the sickest, most to die for gorgeous hair evarrrrrr! <eos> just avoid the fob indians with traditional parents if you're ~~white~~ ~~black~~ not indian. my existence was not to be known by an ex's parents, many moons ago. <eos> that indian ivanka though <eos> who is that? <eos> she was left of trump when they were lighting that candle a couple of minutes ago <eos> it's on a loop so you'll see her again after his speech is over. and, yes, a fine lass! <eos> she is so fucking hot. <eos> i saw on the news that they were saying this will be trump's first address to an ethnic group, totally ignoring the address he made to the polish americans in chicago a few weeks ago. <eos> whites lives don't matter <eos> ...and his visit with haitians in little haiti in florida... <eos> #you're watching live satellite news! <eos> **we're reaching levels of presidential that shouldn't be possible** <eos> you are watching live satellite noose <eos> one time hillary was talking at an event and she made fun of gandhi, to the laughter of the attendees. [here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1mq8koxv_e), it also features her horrific fake accent she was trying to pander with. <eos> they should boil that bitch in vindaloo sauce! <eos> make a post of this!!! fucking cringeworthy <eos> several people have posted the video, but the threads didn't get much traction or attention. you're welcome to post a thread of the video, here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1mq8koxv_e i would be happy if any of you spread the video around and show others. <eos> i guess if the trump to lil jon thing becomes deemed 'way-cist' and the idiots in the msm and on twitter spam it then we can show this video as our response plan haha <eos> what the fuck is wrong with this woman? gas station jokes... really!? she's so out of touch <eos> and biden with his racist 7-11 jokes... <eos> and his child groping episodes, as well. the democrats really know how to pick their vps. we finally get rid of one creep, now she wants kreepy kaine. she simply cannot win this election. not having it. <eos> make america great again! <eos> thanks for picking up on the event but this youtube channel is cancer. maga <eos> **trump is an avatar of shiva!** <eos> # high stamina <eos> were those hindus chanting build the wall? wow! <eos> #अमेरिकी महानता को पुनर्स्थापित! _____________________ #make america great again <eos> thanks... yeah, putin clapping.... farrage laughing... apu? yep, no way that won't get spun harder than pence ignoring a fake gotcha question. <eos> based americans! <eos> i don't live in india so i can't say if people in india have actually seen difference in their daily lives. he seems to have reduced lot of bureaucracy in government and doing good trade deals for foreign companies to invest in india. he is also tough against islamic terrorism and recently carried out surgical strike against terrorists in northern border region. so in lot of ways his plans are similar to trump, modi is also conservative candidate after all. i cringe when idiots on reddit claim trump wouldn't get along with modi or other foreign leaders. modi has more common beliefs with trump than obama, i don't see how they wouldn't get along together. in fact modi must be loving trump's strong anti radical islam stance. <eos> he's addressing groups that i didn't even know existed. the hindu community of new jersey? <eos> it's huge. i live in the next town. edison, nj is basically the indian capitol of the u.s. <eos> there is a video on cnn youtube page with the title trump supporter leave cnn anchor speechless. so what? well, i never received youtube notifications on my phone from channels that i don't follow. the media is hurt and desperate. also, i reported the video for spam <eos> #real talk: shiva is a modern hindu avatar of the rg vedic 'rudra' - - the lord of the hunt, the "roarer" ##seems pretty appropriate. i'm not saying trump is definitely a shivavatara, but like, hillary certainly _is not_. <eos> thanks for link ~ so glad trump did this one - every time i think i can't like him more, he surprises me with more hard work, good will, and intelligence. **go trump** <eos> thank you <eos> praise kek <eos> awesome. beautiful american family. <eos> hindus have been face to face with muslim violence for a long long time. <eos> true hillary is fucking deadmeat <eos> my coworker thinks trump is a clown. he is from inida but is a now a u.s. citizen. i have conversations with him about the election. maybe he will come around but i think he is going to go for hillary. <eos> we reached the point where we can no longer physically watch all of his rallies and all of pence's rallies while also going through wikileaks, fighting twitter wars and still holding down full-time jobs. <eos> as one of the rare "far left trump enthusiasts" i have always been wary of modi... most of my knowledge of him came from [democracy now.](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/4/9/is_india_on_a_totalitarian_path) suffice to say, democracy now is not down with modi. but now that i'm a little more interested in stopping the global spread of wahabist totalitariansim, i'm thinking maybe i should cut the guy some slack. do you have an english language news outlet you would recommend which would help an american understand indian politics a little? <eos> indians (patriotic ones) love modi. he recently ordered multiple strikes on terror camps in pakistan that killed 40 terrorists. he lowered taxes and is a great uniter. just like president trump. <eos> india, secular, pakistan and bangladesh nope, proof in the pudding which religion is better. <eos> aka [the lone savior of mankind](https://i.sli.mg/sk2kpw.jpg) <eos> hindus for trump !!! one thing hindus have common with us, they hate islam!!! <eos> i tried to watch the video, but had to kill myself. thank hindu gods for reincarnation. <eos> dumb people come from all races and religion. i bet this coworker of yours is not a very smart guy. <eos> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cu2polzxeaqw81e.jpg <eos> i just checked the mouse-over screen caps from the past several hours of the clip. has he seriously been talking for the past 90 minutes? holy fuck, i rarely see him top an hour. <eos> that was awesome, he's even doing the smaller events/crowds. <eos> what i'm curious about is nj is a blue state.. is he hoping to turn it red by winning over the hindus? what other states are hindus in, i wonder. <eos> mod needs to ban this guy and whoever pinned that linked. it's embarrassing <eos> dude, you might want to brush up on hindu history. europeans got screwed by the muslims bad, but the muslims fucked the hindus worse than they fuck their goats. <eos> we need more of this! no politically correct pussyfooting around, direct surveillance and confrontation when terroristic contraband is confirmed. <eos> i just mailed out my ballot 😀 count 1 more vote <eos> thanks! battleground state??? <eos> az <eos> fuck yeah! we need extremely good turnout to offset the voter fraud like illegals fucking the whole thing up there <eos> great! what a good feeling! :d <eos> america is going to be a country people will once again respect wealthy strong, and powerful again <eos> we are going to have a phenomenal future together <eos> them graphics tho <eos> eliminate common core <eos> #~~yoga~~maga fire <eos> [hindus for trump](https://sli.mg/a/tbivfr) <eos> three hundred and sixteen billion dollars in intellectual property stolen (by china) <eos> china is stealing our intellectual property <eos> lol @ putin :-d <eos> awkward guy on the right with the tiny jacket. why? <eos> shut your dirty whore mouth, that's other daddy. <eos> what a guy. regardless of the left's narrative that minorities are democrats, donald still reaches out. maga <eos> stam-in-a ... she has none. <eos> can someone explain he cartoons? just curious. <eos> it's about the lols! <eos> thanks, was thinking way to much about it. cheers! <eos> lol no explanation; it's just hilarious edit: and they just added a sleeping hillary picture lmao <eos> lol.. now i feel stupid. thanks! <eos> this station always has them. hilarious. this was promoted as an event that has audience of about 25,000. <eos> yup... will admit b/n long day at work and now enjoying a bottle of wine watching my tigers suck....totally over thought this. thanks! <eos> he is still talking, it stopped for a few minutes, but he is back again <eos> they just started repeating it at 7:55 pm est <eos> it says live, and he is still talking. it isn't live? <eos> they're repeating it. worth seeing again for the amusing graphics. <eos> i dont think its repeating? my red bar is all the way to the right and its at 0:00 he gave everybody hugs and did something and then he walked back over and started to talk again <eos> yeah, it just began again (8:09 pm est). they're looping it. <eos> next - donald trump rally live in green bay, wi. (10-17-16) 4pm <eos> too short an event, but can't blame trump. what a long day! meanwhile... #whereisillary? <eos> i think it was literally a lovefest/dinner thrown for trump by the based hindus. he was exhausted from the past week and they just wanted him to say a few words in public. i bet he is talking a shit ton personally with the hindu at the events one-on-one so he'll still be doing his normal talking, in terms of length compared to his rallies <eos> watched it about 5 times already! and... lovin' it! <eos> hillary is busy memorizing the debate questions and having her answers written out while she sleeps with an iv in her arm. <eos> > meanwhile... #whereisillary? according to her official schedule, she has nothing until the presidential debate on the 19th: https://hillaryspeeches.com/scheduled-events/ nothing scheduled after that for her, either. there's only one rally scheduled on there, and that's for the 20th with president obama. talk about low energy. <eos> lol is putin in the corner? <eos> yes. sometimes this station has hillary hopping across the screen like a kangaroo rat. <eos> lol, yes now i see, its a loop, still great!! <eos> lol in wouldn't expect less from lsn. they're the ones who have dancing putin <eos> the gif they did with putin stroking obama's hair is gold <eos> i like the plate of samosa on his podium... and li'l putin's lovin' it! <eos> daaaammn. didn't see this coming! <eos> i know! i live 5 miles away i had no idea. i would've figured out a way to attend if possible. <eos> and there's wicked amusing pop up images and memes from the based broadcaster! <eos> looks like another prime event! bummer the chat is disabled though. lol <eos> from india here,this is the first time someone from usa has went this close to the tradition on stage,this much co-operation wow,once i remembered george bush in delhi you can tell he was merging just because of political interest and not wholeheartedly. india loves trump. <eos> how does he have so much energy!? <eos> trump in my backyard and i didnt know. god bless him for sitting in rt 1 traffic on a saturday night. <eos> spicy <eos> that's a pretty big crowd for such a specific community <eos> based. <eos> it's on loop <eos> come on dude, we love our muslim brothers and sisters. we don't hate islam, we hate the evil things that it leads people to do! <eos> charlotte and atlanta have huge populations of indian people. <eos> the guy is delusional if he thinks he can win nj at this point. i look forward to the blow out in a month. enjoy your safe space. <eos> it's great when cultures integrate isn't it? <eos> #we do. we do. <eos> when it comes to affirmative action, we are treated even worse than white people. <eos> huma is not hindu or indian. shes saudi, muslim/or jewish since she married wiener. [here is a map, green is india.](http://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thediplomat_2014-02-26_19-53-46-386x231.png) <eos> lol its true <eos> that's a waste of good vindaloo sauce. hch doesn't deserve spicy. <eos> #looks like the wall just got 10 feet higher! <eos> #the wall just doesn't stop, does it?

you're a fickle cuck arent you? <eos> i have a question.... does a male victim of a sexual assault have a voice? i support donald trump as a much better option than hillary clinton. i believe he is a much better person than hillary. as a 7 year old i was sexually assaulted in a hospital emergency room in elkton , maryland. i was was not an adult hanging around a rich man, portraying myself as a sexy person so i could get noticed. i was a 7 year old boy suffering from bronchitis, struggling to breathe on a hospital bed. i don't remember what the offender looked like but i remember being groped and his hands touching me in horrible ways. i am not defending trump's words, but i do want to say that when people accuse him as a sexual predator because of stuff he said, they insult people who have actually suffered by the hands and bodies of actual predators. trump's words were not " i did what i wanted " but rather "they let you do anything". adult woman are saying they are so weak that they can't even stop an out-of-shape old, white dude from making advances . really? how about children that are abused daily because of actual perverts? hillary defended a sex offender, someone she knew was guilty but she chose to cover it up. she harassed and threatened victims of her over-sexed husband. trump admitted to his past problems and apologized for his foolish words i'm tired of women using their sexuality to portray weakness to influence politics . i'm not sexist but women need to quit acting helpless because a man talks inappropriately , get over yourself and focus on those who have actually been affected by real predators . sincerely, - a victim <eos> i am so, so sorry. i am a woman who very much believes we've failed our men and boys. we've allowed and condoned both emasculation and marginalization based solely on being of the male gender. we tell our men that they arent allowed a voice, an opinion, or rights in matters of sexuality, marriage, custody, etc. i love you boys &amp; men, and i'm sorry 3wf went insane and encouraged / facilitated the bullshit that we've dumped on you for the last 20-30 years or so. please know that you are worthy, you deserve to be heard, cared for and about, supported, believed, encouraged. we need you, boys! we need our captains and anyone trying to denigrate you for being men is a fuckface and you should jettison them from your lives. biology, my friends. <eos> > i'm tired of women using their sexuality to portray weakness to influence politics there's a reason why i call those specific people cunts. <eos> sorry for your pain, and sorry our regressive left is so morally bankrupt that they damage actual victims. <eos> i am sorry for what you went through. i agree these trump accusers insult actual victims like yourself and bill clinton's victims. hillary not only defended a child rapist, but she flat out lied about the victim and scarred her forever. <eos> mom....mom!!! get the milk!! so! spicy! <eos> well guys, trump just touched the first lady's penis. i might have to take off my tin foil hat and support hillary clinton. <eos> [removed] <eos> [removed] <eos> must be hard on a marriage when the wife's cock is twice as long as the husband's. <eos> dick cheney is jelly........ <eos> she wants to touch my penis! <eos> shhh stop cussing like a marine! <eos> #michael <eos> #manchelle <eos> back in the day, she used to be referred to as the wookie. <eos> angelo <eos> he sure gets the pouty face going and cries like meryl streep when he wants something, then cheats taxpayers out of money with lavish trips and star-studded dinners to entertain them. i've never been in such a rush to get a family out of our white house other than the carter's. <eos> based shit post right there <eos> #if i could convert all of my karma into upvotes for this post, i would. <eos> #ten feet higher <eos> #what the fuck did you just say about me you little cuck?

i use like 1 spoon full a day in my workout routine and never thought anything of it...fuck <eos> hannity has said he is a commentator, not a journalist - which is why he can plainly state what side he is on. <eos> i'm gonna admit i've always hated hannity, but i could not help from having a huge smile on my face as i listened to him take down hillary like no other talking head will. maybe he's trying to redeem himself for some of his past misdeeds by joining the based centipedes. <eos> hannipede! <eos> someone call the man for fuck's sake! <eos> hannity for press secretary!!!!! <eos> no only reporter. see ben swann https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amab_yarxjk <eos> nothing but love for ben swann, he's been calling out the media since ron paul. <eos> fuck yeah hannity. you'll be remembered as a god in this revolution. <eos> thank you sir, for all your tireless hard work. <eos> hero <eos> ##folks, remember to show your support where it matters. if you can watch the show, watch the show, either on tv or through a fox stream. viewership numbers matter - that's their meter when figuring out what works and what doesnt for them. <eos> i have lived to see the day, where fox news became too he only credible news agency. that it! the world's officially gone off its tits! gone crazy ... nuts ... insane ... bonzo ... no longer in possession of its faculties ... three fries short of a happy meal ... wacko!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <eos> thank you for being fair! <eos> he's not fair, he's admittedly pro-trump. fair would be having the women on who are accusing trump on. him touting out bill & hill clinton's victims is great!...but it's not fair. <eos> given that the msm is a propaganda extension of the hillary campaign, reporting facts from the other side is fair. he's literally up late at night pouring through wikileaks emails himself. he does admit he's pro-trump but argues his case with reality. <eos> > argues his case with reality. dat freudian slip tho. i think 'clarity' or 'objectiveness' would have been better words. you accidentally proved my point & on the internet that means i win. e: considering we agree that sean is a good guy and doing the right thing, we both win fyi :) <eos> hannity readily admits that his fox tv show is an opinion based program. i just heard him say it the other day when he was getting called out by the media. <eos> he himself admitted he was conservative and supported trump when he interviewed eric trump. at least he's honest and open with that. <eos> indeed so - i've heard him explicitly state on multiple occasions "i'm a *television commentator*! i tell that to everyone who asks!" [paraphrased] he doesn't represent himself as a journalist nor does he try to give the impression he's unbiased; exactly the opposite for both cases. people howling about biased journalism on his part, imo, weren't paying much attention in the first place. with that said, he's still got a good deal of objectivity and fair-handedness despite being a centipede, moreso than the supposed journalists out there shooting emails to the hrc campaign. <eos> sean hannity for press secretary <eos> based swim team captain <eos> based irish roman catholic <eos> faux news is nothing but opinion, while fbuiness has some news, and one america is bona fide news. hannity & dobbs actually do some homework on their topics, setting them apart. charles payne on fbusiness is a pro, really like him. http://www.foxbusiness.com/shows/making-money.html <eos> he's a big guy <eos> he might get waterboarded after all. <eos> bill clintons mistress said that hillary smells awful <eos> ama request <eos> all this horrible info on hillary makes me think that the wall just got 10 feet higher! <eos> #[you just activated my trump card!](http://i.imgur.com/vzhgpgk.jpg) [trump's wall just got 10 feet higher! *high energy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qligom24qqc) #total height: 240740ft. we are 80.246% of the distance of hillary's emails if we had 10ft for each one (300000ft)! 59260ft remaining. ***** bot by /u\/tonysesek556 - [about page](https://aws.wariomissed.com/thewallgrows/) - **[taking suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbt77un01wxb3opvwc8llesd1e8jqj5mnkhitd4qqqk/viewform)** - /r/the_donald ***** if you don't want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you, please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist! <eos> [removed] <eos> i've noticed that right-leaning outlets never deny this sort of thing, while left-leaning ones will go to great lengths to proclaim their objectivity, even after being called out. it isn't universal, but it's close enough. <eos> ask sean anything, please! <eos> based based based based based <eos> we need to flood any person spreading the word with love!! send your page views and engage with facebook pages of public people so they know they are on the right track! <eos> can we get an ama?

<eos> sean hannity is not perfect but he is one hell of a patriot! thank you sean. <eos> will someone please call sean hannity? nobody ever call sean. <eos> he needs to keep taking it to megyn kelly. that was glorious <eos> thank you, hannipede and lou! 😀 <eos> sean hannity, neil cavuto, judge jeanine, and eric bolling have been loyal to true conservatism and have supported trump since day 1, true patriots <eos> good ol lumpy. i cant take this guy seriously. <eos> i listen to hannipede every day on my drive home. his program is by far my favorite. <eos> he sounded so frustrated on fridays radio show / he's not quitting and neither will we <eos> not a journalist; he's a commentator: just like every other member of the msm. <eos> never thought i'd ever watch fox.. when i was younger i used to openly bash fox and anyone who liked it.. now look at me, i have a fox news app on my phone that i am constantly checking on, and my tv is 90% of the time set to fox (except for the smelly file) <eos> shouldn't it be biased?

(we dont). <eos> hey now! get that locker room talk out of here!!!!!!!!!! <eos> i think we're getting to a point as a nation that corruption levels may be in the same ballpark of importance as policy. <eos> corruption levels are likely as high as they've ever been, which is not a good thing. we don't have to live with it on the basis that it's tradition. if we don't sort out our house in the next 20-30 years we're all fucked in the biggest way imaginable. nobody's going to look out for the average man, woman, and child when automation supplants us all. no one's going to hand us life saving elixirs out of the goodness of their heart either. if we don't take the reins of our republic back, we're done for. and we're running out of time on that. <eos> character matters. <eos> agreed. you have to negotiate with other world leaders and if they think you are a crooked piece of shit who's word is about as strong as a wet paper towel then your foreign relations will not be good. <eos> i mean it's a cool thing that takes hard work, skill, and dedication that you can't fake or lie. <eos> granted. but it has no bearing on us, as constituents. i don't support any cult of personalities, not even with trump. trump better deliver too, or he can go fuck himself as well. <eos> so she's a shark attack survivor too, neat. <eos> what kind of shark? <eos> an african or european shark? <eos> i don't know that.......wwaaaaaagghhhhhhh!!! <eos> street shark. it was pretty jawesome. <eos> the dnc "doesn't trust her judgment", apparently because she thinks for herself and forms her own opinions. <eos> they don't trust her because she has judgement. <eos> http://khon2.com/2016/09/16/tennessee-man-taken-into-custody-after-threatening-to-murder-tulsi-gabbard-and-mazie-hirono/ wow! someone tried to kill her last month!!! <eos> the dnc also seems to harbor some weird sense of distrust of veterans in general. the way even establishment repubs have harped on the democrats for it is not that far off base. the way jim webb was castigated for being a war veteran when he was running for presidency earlier this year was pretty typical of how the left treats war vets. <eos> i followed the election very closely at the time of the sanders campaign and now that i think back in it, this woman was so incredibly gutsy to do what she did its ridiculous. she will be president one day. check out r/tulsi <eos> agree. i got a little annoyed every tv moment she had was specifically about hillary being a warhawk, but then again her extensive military background somewhat makes her an expert on that topic and maybe not so much in other areas. <eos> bernie should have followed tulsi's lead! <eos> yea probably but honestly i don't know the pressures he was facing as well. dislike bernie all you want, he showed a lot of democrats how to expect more from democratic politicians. now a lot of them can't stand hillary because he put up a tremendous fight. <eos> i do not disrespect bernie! i have nothing but respect for that man, he went where every american wishes they could go ... sadly though, hillary fucked it up on him. <eos> > dislike bernie all you want, he showed a lot of democrats how to expect more from democratic politicians. and then have those expectations crushed. <eos> by other politicians. <eos> a woman worth voting for. my fear is if hillary wins as the first woman president, we won't have another woman for awhile. <eos> hillary is doing unimaginable damage to feminism right now. for a long time forwards it will be linked to her corrupt brand of politics in the minds of many people. <eos> hillary is doing unimaginable damage to every ism. most millenials at least are live and let live about whatever ism or sexuality you are, who cares, but hillary drags her isms through the dirt trying to divide everyone up into these tiny separate controlled boxes, and make everyone a show of, what's a good word, my identity firsters. this is the opposite of what we should be striving for. <eos> the only way to put an end to this is to not let her get elected. show them these tactics do not work. for if they work, there is no reason not to keep doing this. sadly, they use electronic ballots in my state, so apparently i am voting for her whether or not i want to. <eos> well, when you're used to having a committee to form a tweet, that's pretty unusual. <eos> #bill clinton is a rapist <eos> #hillary clinton is guilty of treason <eos> [(that's his fetish.)](http://i.imgur.com/tlf4aht.mp4) <eos> i was not expecting something so tame. i'm pleasantly surprised. <eos> source: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3609 edit: as predicted, as soon as this post his the first page of r/all the ctr downvotes poured in. who downvotes a american hero combat medic?! the left... <eos> jesus christ. read it in an italian accent and it's straight from good fellas <eos> welcome to the basket, major. <eos> hammed dropped! <eos> is that a fresh minted meme i smell? <eos> drop the hammed <eos> he finishes up by saying "wahhhhh, we no give u money!!!!". i hope she replied by saying "hey darnell, why don't you and michael go fuck yourselves?" by the way, why can't michael reach out to her like a fucking real man? why does he need to hide behind darnell like this? what a little cuck boy! representative gabbard probably thought she had no choice but to quietly sit there and eat shit back then, when that inarticulate cock sucker threw his petulant litttle temper tantrum; but instead she has been revealed to be principled and uncorruptible, a true american hero, through and through. i doubt she has much love for our candidate, but that's ok, i have nothing but respect and admiration for her. <eos> > i hope she replied by saying "hey darnell, why don't you and michael go fuck yourselves?" > > > > by the way, why can't michael reach out to her like a fucking real man? why does he need to hide behind darnell like this? what a little cuck boy! #rekt <eos> it's just a shame shills don't see that we're actually rational people. i guess they'd rather paint us as the villains than bother to get to know people. <eos> [here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzyodoxsnm8&t=41s) of tulsi gabbard calling out the dnc and outing clinton as a war-mongerer [at 2:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzyodoxsnm8&t=2m44s) - "i was heavily warned by people who care about me to not endorse senator sanders because of that fear of retaliation [by clinton] that exists in a lot of folks i've heard from." this is a dedicated and respectable woman that i would love to see in the oval office. <eos> same, it would be incredible if our first female president was someone with the character of gabbard. she is what the forefathers had in mind when they created the office, not a scheming criminal. let's hope she doesn't let those entrenched scumbags dissuade her from continuing her course in politics. <eos> god damnit. look at that picture. just look at it. that is presidential material. beautiful, principled, honorable, brave. this is the kind of woman who should have the honor of becoming the first female president. not the scuzzbucket sleazeball war-loving rape-enabling sociopoathic corrupt treasonous lying criminal sack of shit that hillary is. <eos> if she decides to run in a few terms, i'll be right there shitposting in support. <eos> maga!!! <eos> #maga <eos> mary mcdonnell played a great president (laura roslin) in battlestar galactica (2003-2009). i know it's a fictional character, but if she had those traits and type of character, i'd vote for the real life equivalent of that if it was presented to us. <eos> you're frackin'a right! <eos> i love a post like this where i can actually hear the words in my head #maga <eos> this! <eos> 100%. i'm a male and i want to see a female as president. nothing wrong with it at all, so long as she's qualified. clinton is most certainly not. <eos> lawyer (ethically challenged), first lady (rides on coattails), senator (carpetbagger), sos (so incompetent she couldn't be tried). <eos> i don't want to explain to my daughter how the first female president seized up on the un floor and had to be dragged out. <eos> or why 3/4s of the world is in nuclear holocaust. <eos> i wish more bernouts actually had a conscience like tulsi does. she's an awesome woman and one of the few in the democratic party to stand by her convictions. of course that is why they had to try and destroy her. she should have run instead of bernie as she would not have folded like a cheap suit. <eos> i would vote for her purely based on integrity <eos> yeah she just would have had an unfortunate "suicide"/"car accident"/"gym accident"/"theft". not running probably saved her life. or even more troubling her families lives. <eos> i agree, when i [saw this image from wikileaks involving her being guilted by the dnc yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/c72euqb.jpg) i sent a copy of it to her with a thanks for her service and being one of the few on the government standing her ground. and even though i felt different on certain issues, having someone of her character and integrity in her position is more important than someone who conforms to my ideals. it's not much, but i hope myself and others helped reaffirm her confidence for her fight. <eos> she will run next time and she will crush. imagine her against a paul ryan type? #backtosleeppaul would be trending from sea to shinning sea <eos> i'm a bernout and hillary clinton is deplorable. i'll never vote for her. <eos> she probably would have been targeted for being a war veteran like they did with jim webb who triggered all sorts of people for him being a major vietnam veteran with some amazing adventures there. i don't think it's really possible for democrats to successfully vet and support war vets. it seems they are unwelcome among their ranks. <eos> check out jason kander in mo. <eos> #partisanship is destroying this nation. **its time for a cleanout in dc, and trump is the one to do it. its time for our elected officials to represent us as they are meant to do.** **the founders warned us about what splintering into political parties would do to our glorious republic. they weren't wrong and its happening** **maj. gabbard stood up for her beliefs as an american and was cast down by the establishment. this cannot continue** #we are no longer represented by our leadership. **we pay their salaries. we decide who stays and who meets the curb. we must, all of us, vote.** **pray god that is enough.** <eos> it's a strange system. english law set up a 'no taxation without representation' maxim to ensure the english merchantmen could not do what the us is doing to its citizens now. or rather, the elite fool the public into thinking they are being represented, but the elite are just stringing the cattle along to the abattoir. <eos> hey, idk who she will vote for, but she has my respect and affection. she's just maga-ing as best she knows how. <eos> same and i have a very good feeling she'll vote stein or maybe trump even, it will not be hillary. <eos> http://mauitime.com/news/politics/longtime-bernie-sanders-supporter-tulsi-gabbard-endorses-hillary-clinton-for-president/ <eos> sad <eos> as a coat wearing, disavowed bernout voting trump i agree. i'm all for a woman president, just not *this* woman. i'd happily vote for tulsi. <eos> she'd have beaten clinton <eos> i very much hope gabbard can be the first female president <eos> i second this! <eos> i just want bernie people to know that we joke about the bernout shit. you can call us whatever you want as long as we're together. <eos> bingo. i'm so fucking tired of hearing that i "just resent" her. we've been 100% vindicated by wikileaks. <eos> just wait for o'keef's nuke on monday. and i'm sure the white wizard is saving the best stuff for last. <eos> this country had a chance...i think bernie was robbed. bernie v trump would have been the greatest time for the country. there would have been a chance for catharsis. now we have epic levels of depression, anxiety, and hatred driving things. take me for instance. pre bern out, i was all about "one love man, we're all in this together" to post bern out "god fucking dammit i hate this woman and cannot fucking believe the extent and levels of corruption".... #**and we haven't even seen any of her emails yet!!!!** i'm so fucking tired of hearing that he's the personifcation of all the things that have been holding women back...**he's the god damned last line of defense for us against the worst scum in the universe.** <eos> each day that goes by with these new leaks is making my anxiety worse. it's like we're fighting a uphill battle, with no fucking end in sight. i truly believe i see a civil war in the near future, national guards calling a coup and siding with the citizens, etc. <eos> if she's elected after all the upcoming voter and electoral fraud evidence that's coming soon, she will have zero legitimacy with much of the nation. <eos> > i see a civil war in the near future <summons inner pence> woaaaahhhhh there...noooo...don't say that..... <summons inner trump> my inner vp & i haven't talked...i disagree..let's appoint a special investigator that isn't an establishment shill!!! <eos> civil war isn't possible because the majority of america will believe what they are told by the media. you'll never get enough support to upset the establishment. there is always a lot of talk of overthrowing british rule and having guns etc, but that is only talk. america was bought and paid for long ago and the majority will never care enough to even change their vote let alone something more serious. the two party system has to die to inject life back in. fat chance that will happen, most the states are so brainwashed they'd never change their vote. <eos> i don't understand why people are so content with the level of corruption that is going on. people are voting for hillary despite her past and ongoing scandals... <eos> i haven't heard of this, what's the story? <eos> she stepped down (read: fired) from her position as dnc vice chair to support senator sanders <eos> no, she actually stepped down. you're not allowed to endorse candidates as a dnc position and she has the character to abide by that. she left so she could endorse bernie without abusing her position. <eos> as a former army officer, she's no stranger to having a job which prevents you from having a public political opinion. nice to see she's still living by the army values <eos> acting with integrity and respect for our political system within the dnc gets you threatened by the dnc. being corrupt and acting in a nefarious manner gets you promoted to honorary chair of the clinton campaign. <eos> i'm not disputing that the dnc is treating her like shit. i fully believe that. i'm just saying i do believe that she genuinely elected to step down because that is what a person with character would do and i believe she is a person with character. <eos> oh yeah, of course, i'm just pointing out the non-existence of character, morality, and common decency in the dnc party as a whole. tulsi showed that there are still, at least, a few with moral fortitude. <eos> she was the only one to stand her ground at the dnc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vclp0iowim <eos> here's the story... clinton allies punish super delegate for supporting sanders http://www.trump-conservative.com/news/wikileaks-emails-clinton-allies-punish-super-delegate-for-supporting-sanders/ <eos> these people are fucking savages. if you're not vis us zen vee vill crush you! <eos> > you have called both myself and michael kives before about helping your campaign raise money, we no longer trust your judgement so will not be raising money for your campaign. follow the money, if you do not fall in line your judgement is questioned and you are cut off from the establishment machine. tulsi stood up for what she believed and i respect that. we are standing up now but with this movement the establishment has no power. just one more reason for why we need to win. <eos> morals, integrity, and she spits in the face of the clintons. why the shit can't this woman be running for president? i'd vote for her <eos> combat medical badge. that really elevates her in my eyes. i've got her back. <eos> she looks like a boss. <eos> she really is. <eos> absolutely love this woman. a true inspiration on what a real politician should be like. <eos> i seriously see this woman running for president some day. she would be a fantastic first female president. this is a woman girls should see as a role model. <eos> she is pretty much a lock for 2020 edit:i mean a lock for the dem nom. no way trump loses his second term. <eos> not if the dnc has blackballed her. <eos> think we've all seen this one before. <eos> waste of time. nobody is going to defeat president trump mid-maga. they will all have to wait until 2024. <eos> we have the best people in our cabinet, don't we folks! secretary of defense tulsi gabbard under trump!!! <eos> how could she endorse hillary though? she's as spineless as sanders. http://mauitime.com/news/politics/longtime-bernie-sanders-supporter-tulsi-gabbard-endorses-hillary-clinton-for-president/ <eos> she is still against the no fly zone in syria, and wants to end the war to overthrow the syrian government. i bet the establishment hates her cause her counter views. <eos> dismissing people like gabbard and sanders as spineless is easy. as a leftists i'm left with two candidates i deeply dislike, but my views are essentially antipodal to those of trump. my state isn't in play, so i don't have to stomach voting for clinton, but i might if i was in a swing state. i ask sincerely, what is the centipede's pitch to the leftist who supported sanders for both his integrity and his policy positions? <eos> one of the better dems definitely <eos> true patriot ^^^ shes a badass, don't fuck with her! <eos> a true patriot folks. <eos> what's this about? <eos> [her name is tulsi. she's a hot surfer milf congresswoman from hawaii.](https://i.sli.mg/wun46q.jpg) she sided with bernie early in the election, she even renounced her co chair position in the dnc to protest...giving away her superdelegate status as well. tulsi is one of the few based dems, like jim webb. an email was leaked from dems stating that her decision to back bernie meant they would not raise money for her. <eos> principles. one of the reasons i kinda respected bernie despite his commie policies. maga <eos> i mean, i give her credit for holding out, but she *did* eventually "fall in line"... >"given the remaining choices, like bernie sanders, i will be casting my vote for hillary clinton," gabbard told the honolulu star-advertiser [http://archive.is/6o7sc](http://archive.is/6o7sc) i'm sure they left her no choice, though. <eos> people don't realize that the clinton machine has killed many to further their aims. a bernie supporting super delegate would not be any more difficult to cuck by threats of 'accidents'. <eos> she must disavow <eos> fuckin a right! <eos> nope. she won't. http://mauitime.com/news/politics/longtime-bernie-sanders-supporter-tulsi-gabbard-endorses-hillary-clinton-for-president/ <eos> i just looked at her political standings after the first time this was pointed out. she perfect for her constituents. she made me realize that maybe we should vote democrat for local policy and conservative for national policy. she's a perfect representive of reaching across the aisle, but the dems want her out because of it. shameful. she really could be perfect for commander in chief after trump. we should get behind this patriot! <eos> patriot af <eos> i remember watching her make nomination speech and even though i was a trump train og, when she said bernie sanders and the movement of love, i fell in love. god bless this patriot and thank you for the preservation of dignity among a group with so little! <eos> i first heard her speak at the democratic convention and i really liked her. i still don't know much about her career as a politician, but standing up for what she believes in has earned my respect. <eos> fuck bill and hillary just shows you they hate all our vets it doesn't matter to them if they are republican or democrat <eos> so she got fucked over by the dnc because she stood up for democracy and freedom and went against the demon hillary? alright, i don't care that she's a dem or a lib...she's cool enough for me! #http://khon2.com/2016/09/16/tennessee-man-taken-into-custody-after-threatening-to-murder-tulsi-gabbard-and-mazie-hirono/ btw, some guy was arrested for threatening to assassinate her last month!!!! <eos> i actually met tulsi gabbard several years ago before she became major. she is quite a humble person, and sensible no less. thank you for your service, major. <eos> she's voting for hillary. <eos> now this is a real woman worthy of respect unlike all the horde of hypocritical autistic feminazi cunts who are sniveling about trump's obvious joke in a video. <eos> it was very clear from the start of her resignation what was actually going on. imagine how infuriating to have to comply with dws and hrc! i don't know if i would have been graceful. i hope she lends her support to maga. <eos> >this e-mail and any files transmitted with it are intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed. if the reader of this e-mail is not the intended recipient or the employee or agent responsible for delivering the message to the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use dissemination, forwarding, printing or copying of this e-mail is strictly prohibited. oops. <eos> it doesn't say "c" so at this point what does it matter?

i need my fix man. give it to me! <eos> she's also a surfer! very cool woman! <eos> integrity of the most perfect kind! <eos> # based centipedes! alert, alert, alert! she is a hillary supporter! she will not get a coat, but she serves to show how quickly the dems will cull one of their own, as if she was nothing. they are not acting their best, guys. it will be yuge in november, whether we have all of congress with nice leather coats, or they all rot in the cold! # **maga** <eos> she is terrible about getting back to people though. she is know for hardly ever writing back to her constituents. <eos> first female president, tulsi gabbard. check out her dnc speech where she basically just flips the bird to hillary for 6 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8kpa-vp_qm she's like a cross between trump and bernie. check out some of her positions: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/15/rep-tulsi-gabbard-the-democrat-that-republicans-love-and-the-dnc-cant-control/ <eos> what tulsi did by leaving the dnc and turning her back on the clintons and their ilk took *guts*. guts in the sense of the word as most of us would understand it. but as a decorated veteran who is primarily worried about "regime change wars" (as she so eloquently and frequently says)....turning her back on such scum is just another day in the park for her. and for her to go back to the convention, nominate bernie and say this in front of all of those globalist fucks forever cemented her as one of the "good guys": https://youtu.be/o8kpa-vp_qm?t=145 <eos> grab her by the epaulette! <eos> tulsi 2024! <eos> i wish they would have run a candidate like this. at least she is respectable. <eos> i'd rather have her as secretary of state than john bolton. <eos> i love people with integrity, regardless of politics. <eos> tulsi is about one of the only dems i like. shame to see her threatened by crooked's henchmen. <eos> what a beautiful woman. http://tulsigabbardblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tulsi_gabbard_high1a.jpg <eos> if there's a way to contact her, we should link her to this thread to let her know we support her. <eos> she must bend the knee to president trump before she gets any support from me. <eos> being a democrat from hi, i figured she would be for gun control... i was wrong. [maga](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-11-gun-bills-tulsi-gabbard-wont-supportwhile_us_57635ad1e4b0092652d744e9) <eos> hillary is a misogynist! should be the new phrase. <eos> anyone going with hillary is part of the problem. thinking outside the box is actually leaping out of the box of corruption. <eos> love her. the character of a warrior. she would make an extraordinary president. <eos> tulsi is based! <eos> i tweeted respect and props to her the day of the leak. she has two twitter accounts. give her respect! show her the educated public is not partisan! <eos> she's got a bright future once the clinton cartel is nipped in the bud. <eos> we should all email her and get her aboard the train. <eos> has anyone tweeted her the link? and thanked her? i don't see it. a berber convert should do so - its honorable <eos> the left hates strong, attractive women. they always do. <eos> no, she wasn't. she asked a couple of top level fundraisers (note: not the dnc) to raise money for her. they didn't like what she said about their preferred candidate, so they didn't raise any money for her. also: hello from planet earth. how's the weather where you are? <eos> i'm pretty sure this was a troll post. gabbard may not have liked what was going on but she hates trump. <eos> some people still love there country. i love my country. i always have, and always will. it is being in these shoes that i can say without a doubt , hillary does not love america. <eos> never thought i'd see a post about tulsi on r/the_donald. the god-emperor brings people together, folks! <eos> #f <eos> f <eos> my captain my captain! <eos> while i thank her for her service, she announced that she will be voting for hillary. <eos> how can women vote for hillary?! she will set the worst 'precedent' possible for a woman president. if a woman is ever going to be president, tulsi gabbard or michelle obama are light years away better to be 'the first us woman president'. <eos> i've never had a problem with a female potus. as with the boys, it's who gets elected that matters. hillary the crooked grifter has a horrible political track record of failure, and a string of questionable death surrounding her that would make a serial killer proud. <eos> a real life jackie sharp. me likey. <eos> yeah, but she's voting for hillary. <eos> she's voting for hillary, guys... <eos> going live! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ take my high energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ <eos> so, uhh - archived version? had to cook dinner and the fucking web player kept giving me errors about "working on playing!111" and apparently linux and chromium doesn't get along with their fuckassed site - nevertheless, i'd like to sit down and hear it. (((dinner was pretty kickass, too tired to eat what i cooked for myself.))) <eos> focus on the lies she has told most recently, specifically to the american people during the election. the more recent the more it shows her sociopathy. collusion and coverup with the msm is a plus. <eos> how her husband ended glass-steagall leading to the financial crisis, "we came, we saw, he died", how her foreign policy created and fed isis. also, direct quotes reported by the secret service guys who worked her detail are both telling and damning. <eos> #based amplitude-modulating leak merchant <eos> great work there. any chance for a recording? <eos> how can i get on am radio? <eos> listen to it and just call in/contact the hosts of these shows via email or snail mail/etc? am doesn't get a whole lot of attention these days with sirius and clear channel and the like - we've really gone back to the days where you can send a quick letter and get a response from the person you're trying to talk to. not always, and who knows, but that's my pretty educated guess. offer to discuss the issues. they might well take you up on it. (disclaimer: i loved music and played it, and neither listen to much of it nor listen to [am-fm fucking radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3olugyeto) unless i'm in the car...i imagine they'd love to get more attention - and i suspect the ham/ham (? can't remember) radio enthusiasts would love the am band to not get sold off by fcc sychophants...they kinda ate shit on the tv digitalization shite) <eos> great job centipede! way to represent maga! heard the interview !! <eos> talk about the rigged electronic voting booths <eos> just finished listening to your segment. great job. you covered everything i was interested in and more! that last minute of talk about how these accusations are conveniently timed and how it's surprising how trumps never been hit by these accusations before this was very interesting!!! thanks for your work centipede. <eos> good show. <eos> the days do blend - it's like christmas for a week straight. <eos> i've always had trouble sleeping on chrismas eve. these last several days i'm averaging 4 hrs a night. if it keeps up like this, i'm going to have a bad time. <eos> i guess that you're...getting tired from all this winning <eos> you've got me there. i haven't got a fraction of trump's stamina. he awes me. <eos> focus on voter fraud. george soros is on the board that controls the voting booths. sounds like a confliction of interest. <eos> fantastic show, well done <eos> poor gary. i think he has a screw loose. his ctr talking points fell apart. <eos> what a moron. let's disagree to disagree <eos> no joke <eos> can you repeat the phone #? <eos> 303-696-1971 <eos> gahhh jut heard its ending, i failed big league :( would have loved to tune in earlier <eos> call now because we've only got one more segment <eos> based, good job fam <eos> #droppin soros bombs <eos> i didn't follow......these are the people we have to try so hard to red pill 😥 <eos> wow john is my hero edit wow gary is an idiot **fucking based john in fucking nevada** <eos> wow that guy from nevada went in hard <eos> #oh shit live stumpings <eos> the best kind. <eos> omg based caller <eos> wtf is this guy talking about trump having a brain damge... and saying hilary is better wow this guy sounds like an cuck... i bet he is hillary clinton supporter. <eos> yes she is huge on going "on the record" through her media contacts with one view, and keeping another view completely off the record. since nobody has a copy of the transcript, and she hasn't officially acknolweged "on the record", oh, yes this is my transcript, or yes i said this in that meeting, it doesn't get acknowledged in the media. <eos> i want trump to win. one way is to end hillary. i know other said it but this 3 minutes is it: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4xm8ao can we plese get media on this? <eos> is bill down in the caribbean having his way with 13 year olds again? <eos> correct the record https://www.wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/5636 <eos> podesta owned 75,000 shares in russian energy companies connected to putin love to here your comments <eos> corruption, corruption, corruption: [they bus people around to vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=judtcxiqqm0&feature=share) soros connection to the [smartmatic voting machines](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/57gne4/red_alert_vice_chairman_of_george_soros_highly/). dare you bring up credible allegations of [murder](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/56h01c/i_want_you_to_get_rid_of_all_these_bitches_hes/)? <eos> - saudi arabia funding isis also donating to hillary. - the $1m check from qatar on bill clinton's "birthday" (who are also funding isis) - the disparaging remarks to catholics. - the "needy latinos" line. - hillary saying in her speeches that saudi arabia is trying to get nuclear weapons. - they rigging of the primary and seeing bernie's supporters as nothing more than losers, nothing more than votes. - hillary really being against gay marriage. - collusion with the press (media totally corrupt). - them confessing hillary deleted the emails, and potus knew. - them confessing obamacare is a disaster. - hillary's brother being involved in "hustling gold mining deals" in haiti - pivot to them only donating 2% of the charity money. <eos> you're doing us proud, centipede! <eos> this is great dude!!!! <eos> **4chan fbi anon said to focus on the clinton foundation, the more criminal stuff is there.** <eos> hell y'all! let's *maga* <eos> clinton foundation pay for play <eos> https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56f871ec2eeb8183c2c79661/t/58005f3ee3df2898d6a5be14/1476419391134/podestafiles.pdf good pdf that sums up leaks 1-6. send it to your producer. <eos> massive voter fraud. i.e. going to nursing homes and workers holding their fingers over trump's name, telling the elderly person to circle hillary ' name. going to mental hospitals, telling them to fill in the ballot "here" (points to hrc). person isn't necessarily aware of their decision. fake ids to get illegals to vote. <eos> heres a good list https://www.reddit.com/r/wayofthebern/comments/57lzfk/5th_post_of_highlights_from_wikileaks_podesta/?st=iuboyeo5&sh=93229a3e <eos> talk about soros connected to company that makes voting machines. <eos> here is an interesting story about how julian might have been pushed into creating wikileaks.. it might be a good lead in. https://pando.com/2013/09/14/how-the-us-government-inadvertently-created-wikileaks/ <eos> scalia! haha! <eos> not a single link posted like op wanted. smh <eos> :( <eos> email 1459 look at the link to the map in the email and the last line of dialogue about a vacancy. that location on the map in this wikileak is right where scalia died. http://archive.is/frxn3 <eos> is it possible to listen to you on internet? and from another country than the us:)? <eos> yes. click the link above. <eos> thank you m8 <eos> don't forget to explain a little about wikileaks too, they may not know much about it, or trust it. <eos> how they got rid of obama's emails to/from hrc <eos> goldman sachs transcript - pt. 1 > "you know, we have to get back to at least trying to make evidence based decisions. i know that sounds so simplistic, but the ideological partisan position on all sides -- because there are people who refuse to look at facts and deal with them, coming from many different perspectives -- really undermines confidence in the people. the american people are smart. they may not be living and breathing politics, but they're looking and they're thinking: come on, guys. get it together. you ought to be able to make a deal of some sort." hillary calls for a better informed public at the same time she is complicit in overclassification and the persecution of the press (attack on wikileaks). it's very clear she means that *government* must be informed. there is a contempt for the public here and a total lack of understanding that only an informed public can lead to an informed governance, not vice versa. <eos> things that stick. focus on marijuana. the secret promises to banks. see if there's any way you can fit haiti in there. and the fact that they prove she knows what she's doing and is obviously guilty the no fly zone f that obama just bombed yemen! <eos> talk about the clinton foundation, soros, and obama. how they are all tangled together. <eos> use of foundation funds & staff for bill & chelsea's other for-profit businesses edit: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1819 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8513 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9938 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3399 also see attachment https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10482 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9088 see review notes in attachment regarding lack of internal controls & staff understanding re:conflicts of interest, work outside of foundation <eos> talk about scalia, the catholic comments, the leaked questions brazille had. <eos> maybe give some time to this guy, anon fbi, who is likely one of the leakers. he's been right about everything so far. https://i.redd.it/lz22l7pv2nrx.png <eos> this <eos> the fact that she is against single payer health care in private. <eos> russia and assad blocked a saudi based pipeline through syria to sell to eu. saudi then: 1) went to proxy war with russia 2) flooded their oil on market to drive down prices to hurt russia 3) unlease isis on syria to take out assad 4) donate $50m to clinton foundation 5) us state dept now on board to overthrow assad 6) blame russia for everything as they must stop protecting assad 7) ??????????????????? 8) us goes to war against united nations security counsel vote, they remove assad 9) syria is a failed state 10) isis takes over 11) saudis have a new pipeline and protection 12) hillary uses this new red scare to control the media and masses. 13) dissidents are labeled unamericana and arrested, social media closed down she is working with isis to overthrow assad like she did gaddafi. russia is not happy. putin has called back students and relatives to the motherland. russian television is warning of nuclear war soon. hillary wins its ww3, nuclear style. no jokes, its happening right now. **maga**. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3839467/are-ready-war-russia-tells-civilians-check-bomb-shelters-gas-masks-nuclear-forces-advance-prepares-cyber-strike.html http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-secret-stupid-saudi-us-deal-on-syria/5410130 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3835942/this-step-war-russian-citizens-react-fear-reports-moscow-ordered-officials-fly-home-relatives.html edit: people are waking up. hillarys facebook is fucking gold right now. https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton <eos> best comment here <eos> **the foundation.** chelsea conducted informal audit that revealed; no controls, no board meetings, no audit committee. teneo exec. doug band bitched about daughter, cvc, messing up the racket. -* also, "public" versus "private" positions in wall street speech <eos> the one about how her advisors want a compliant and uncritical populace. <eos> the fake trump insta post. seriously really fucked up how the dnc thinks they can get away with such a smear tactic. absolutely disgraceful <eos> the emails where they discuss bypassing the congressional subpoenas and discussing what to release, what to delete, executive orders. basically everything to do with the email controversy. <eos> scalia possible assassination. for supreme court stronghold <eos> no. <eos> agree, conspiracy theory. stick to facts. <eos> link the emails for him to study folks! stay safe brave mod <eos> draw comparisons between reagan's contra scandal and clinton funneling weapons to syria. how they went to jail for funnelling weapons (without congressional approval) to anti-communist rebels..and they went to prison for that. but clinton funnels weapons to enemies of the us and runs for president. <eos> obama knowing about the private server and lying to the people, then using executive privilege to cover it up. <eos> the obama implication. seriously, my spider senses tell me that this is the biggest catch. <eos> bjmp bump bump <eos> talk about ross perot and nafta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpivi0cbcmg <eos> catholicism is a bastardization of the faith, public vs private opinion, acknowledging that saudi arabia funds terrorism yet accepts donations and coupled with the email showing she is beholden to the interests of her biggest donors and that they sell influence. those two coupled together is a kill shot all its own. <eos> holding different positions publicly and privately <eos> this one ties in with the other private speeches, so as long as op mention those i'd think this would get mentioned too. <eos> depending on where you're located, the catholic ones could be good. if you're in the northeast i'd definitely hit on those. <eos> get us a recording after please. best of luck and thanks for your service. 😃 <eos> the speeches. the speech where she exposes the technique used to track osama to a room full of bankers for money. <eos> also, one speech where she admitted that creating a no fly zone would require a lot of civilian casualties on the syrian side, since their air defense systems are in large cities. and that boots will be needed on the ground. <eos> this is a big one in my opinion. no fly zones would require a lot of effort and could even escalate us to a war with russia. <eos> hillary's staff concerned about her deleting subpoenaed emails. <eos> do one that mostly focuses on the people themselves, her hatred of catholics, mexicans, arabs, etc. <eos> you could probably just stick with short quotes of these ones, and focus most of the time on the more "complex" emails like the saudis and the private speeches. like, just briefly quote the insults they've said in the beginning like how podesta said hillary hates the term everyday american, and the catholics one. i think i remember there being one (edit; from the dnc leaks, not podesta emails) from the dnc's chair of lgbt outreach (or whatever the title was) where he referred to gays and others as horrible people, though the context was a bit vague on that one if i recall correctly. after that, when you have people's attention, move onto the others. <eos> goldman sachs speeches. hillary's every word being planned by someone else. keeping the emails from obama <eos> public position: - regulate the banks - single payer private position: - bank deregulation - hates single payer <eos> [deleted] <eos> dont link to them do you,want this sub to get shut down!? people from here are gonna brigade them!!!!!! <eos> shit, you're right, i took it down. good lookin' out <eos> if it was /r/[redacted], wouldn't be us brigading. it would be ctr running a false flag. shits fucked. <eos> no it wasn't a political sub, but it's best to be safe than sorry. <eos> public: pro green energy / al gore private: pro fracking / environmentalists should get a life. this is just hypocrisy, no matter where you stand on the issues. <eos> * link to this [email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927) <eos> i only have an hour. post which emails you think i should focus on. link to them if you can. <eos> mention the person who hacked his twitter using the emails which verifies the legitimacy of the emails <eos> the dates of the emails stop after seth rich was murdered. wiki leaks assange hinted it was seth rich. it was not the russians. "the russians are interfering with our election by using democrat emails to prove the democrats rigged the election" - h <eos> whatever you discuss, be sure to have each link public facing so you can redpill with sources. whether that is here, or on the stations website, it should be somewhere. i vote for obama's implications, the proof of hillary having knoledge of the deletion of emails, and podesta having access to ts material. <eos> please talk about this email https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/57nqns/concrete_proof_of_media_collusion_going_back/ i've been trying to bring attention to it because it completely shatters anyone trying to deny the media is colluding with clinton. off the record collusion from before clinton announced with abc, bloomberg, cbs, cnn, daily beast, gpg, huffington post, msnbc, nbc, new yorker, new york times, people mag, politico, vice, vox, yahoo, univision, buzzfeed, et. al. <eos> drop some easter eggs for us centipede. i'll let my fellow users decide which leaks are best. <eos> saudi arabia funding both isis and shillary. this is a fact that breaks the conditioning of shillary people. <eos> and bill receiving a 1 million check from qatar <eos> "happy birthday, wjc" -terrorists <eos> and that saudi arabia, qatar and the whole middle east hate gays and will kill you. if your a woman you'll get beat for showing your ankle <eos> or, as a woman, driving a car by yourself. or being with a man who isn't your husband. i know women who have gone to the middle east (egypt esp) and they say it's common for men to just grab your butt if you're dressed like an american. <eos> i'm literally shaking <eos> as long is it's not genitals, the dems will be ok with it i spose <eos> together with the 28 pages showing how the saudis were involved in 9/11. then showing how clinton knew the saudis were providing "clandestine financial and logistical support" to isis back in 2013. then showing how she took $10-$25 million dollars in donations from saudi arabia through the clinton foundation after the fact. oh and don't forget the $6 billion worth of weapons, ammo, and vehicles that our government is selling to the country who they admit are supporting our enemies. sorry i didn't post direct links. i can find them for you if you're interested. <eos> i liked how paul joseph watson kept drilling it on infowars. hillary takes money from countries that kill gays, and allow husbands to beat their wives. yet she's a champion for women's rights. also watch this!!! https://youtu.be/duwczukfy4i?t=813 <eos> does it actually break the conditioning? <eos> it certainly works better than most arguments. <eos> thats fucking nothing, its saudi arabia and hillary funding isis!!! <eos> [**we're breaking the conditioning!!**](https://youtu.be/gil_bnijcfg) <eos> open borders with the entirety of central and south american, and hence some of the most violent gangs in the world. <eos> we the media now <eos> it's true, i don't trust mass media to do their jobs and provide me with true, relevant news anymore; this subreddit and others have become my news source now. and to think i started lurking here a few weeks ago just for the jokes. i salute everyone who has been here from the very beginning. <eos> > and to think i started lurking here a few weeks ago just for the jokes. i salute everyone who has been here from the very beginning. we love you fellow centipede <eos> could someone actually explain the context of centipede?

<eos> cnn: trump sends assassination squad to our headquarters. <eos> cnn: we are in fear of our lives, mob of red hats surrounding our building. cnn: we just want to remind you that the blm protest was very peaceful (except for the black man shot and killed by a black protester) <eos> bahha <eos> kek <eos> typical media spin! <eos> we're gonna need some video fellow patriot... <eos> https://www.periscope.tv/w/atfcktfqwetkdljiwe5fzxz8mvjer2xvalpmt01lto6ntim-vyuszirgpr2bnf14g5emeawo_j7pok6t0xso https://www.periscope.tv/w/atfc9tfqwetkdljiwe5fzxz8mwvhs2jstw1qdljkwnpswmvqllq1ls3jlgo8lhutnizdmyoyld9dzjgti9ys <eos> how many people are there? <eos> if some people can organize 100+ people to stand outside of cnn and demand that they cover wikileaks, they might be forced to address the issue and bring attention to media bias for people who aren't aware. have a designated group of people, preferably females/minorities, prepped to speak to any news teams that show up to give scripted/well thought out responses to possible questions. maybe even throw in how the media is covering unsubstantiated accusations for days, but not reporting when those accusations get debunked. <eos> yeah, we need better organization. i didn't hear about this gathering until this morning ~10am. by the time i got done with everything i needed to do it was already 2pm, and i wouldn't have been able to make it until ~1hour ago after driving and finding parking. if i at least knew this was happening last night, i could've just taken the metro and saved a lot of money in fuel/parking. <eos> we had about 20 at max. not a lot of people but a whole lot of energy. <eos> dammit, i was just by there yesterday at that same time, would have loved to join. sounds like fun! <eos> keep it up. peaceful protests and let your voice be heard. <eos> well... by the same math used by clinton to claim how many show up to see her speak: 20 x 400 = i do not recall...so let's say you had 13000 people there. <eos> the math checks out! -evan <eos> ha ha. as a doctor, i guess i am just used to saying "pharmacy to dose." so i can see why clinton has problems with math...her pharmacist is to busy dispensing meds to keep her up right. <eos> oh yeah, i was joking along those lines, too. making a pretend "fact check" that supports a clinton claim. also: geaux tigers! <eos> #make news great again! <eos> white male with shaved head holding a trump flag....reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaacist. <eos> careful. last time there was an assault on one of the centipedes. <eos> too late. turns out op was depressed and had a gym accident. those damn barbells did it! <eos> silent majority supports trump... assaulting centipede would seem like a bad idea at this point. <eos> i can confirm, the silent majority in ca is strong. there was a group down here in san diego today over the freeway with signs. gf and i honked and cheered but were going furniture shopping so we didn't stop and join them <eos> that was over the 5...saw it on my way to la jolla a few weeks ago. <eos> yeah i saw it today over the 5 by mission bay! was so happy i made a thread about it here! <eos> closeted san diego trump supporter checking in! <eos> airhorn! https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=grrdgrpopnw maga <eos> try [this](http://alex.supply/montage/) airhorm 'pedes. <eos> love it! <eos> redirected to not found?

how many people, is there a stream, what are the reactions of people around, pictures, etc.? <eos> #thanks based centipede! <eos> **more pictures** <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqnhdvcvrsg&feature=youtu.be&t=13m54s <eos> holy shit!!! <eos> that part needs to be cut and posted separately <eos> this needs to happen everyday!! i wish i was there with you guys!! <eos> cnn: trump rioters outside of cnn headquarters, more at 5. <eos> get everyone to chant clinton news network!!! <eos> #patriots! <eos> [*don't let that flag hit the ground my fellow veteran!*](https://www.google.com/search?q=clinton+flag+hitting+ground&oq=clinton+flag+hitting+ground&aqs=chrome..69i57.10986j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=utf-8#safe=off&q=clinton+flag+fall+ground) <eos> you look like a fucking white male, well done! <eos> simply amazing.. great job guys, hopefully this attracts more people as well <eos> **true patriots!!!** <eos> #centipedes attack <eos> thank you for doing this cnn is terrible. <eos> let's take this to the capitol <eos> keep up the great work - bless you <eos> bless. may the high energy be with you. all the rare pepes for loyal centipedes. get this man another coat <eos> #cnn sucks <eos> killarys globalist fucking cock <eos> drove by you today! laughed at the two hillbots across the street. power on, centipede! <eos> niiiceee! <eos> you guys are slacking big time <eos> lots of respect. keep fighting the good fight! <eos> saw you guys on tv! <eos> just don't "peacefully" protest and start looting stores in the area.... <eos> everyday until they become actual journalists we need people out in front of their la and nyc offices! <eos> awesome!!! great idea! <eos> breaking: trump protester tragically dies after falling backwards onto some bullets <eos> #true patriots <eos> show the video fuck your app <eos> where can i get a flag like that? <eos> that is so rock star cool of you guys to get out there and meet up to do this. awesome! <eos> why can't hundreds do this?, they probably couldn't even get normal coverage without at least acknowledging the crowd <eos> someone should make a copy of this trump flag, but replace his name with the word, "truth". make no other changes. <eos> real question here. do you all think the media is corrupt because of all the bad press trump gets? or because they don't do enough negative hillary stories? some combination? i ask because i really don't watch that much news to accurately monitor this stuff. <eos> > i ask because i really don't watch that much news to accurately monitor this stuff you have the stink of low energy and the comment history of a drugged cuck. <eos> both. the trump grope nonsense are literally just smears, they're all debunked within days of coming up. they're just an attempt to taint him. if there was anything actionable, they'd have come forward a long time ago. he's a billionaire tv star, there is plenty of story and profit opportunity there. the lack of coverage of wikileaks is most disturbing. the evidence in total paints a picture of a corruption and colluding campaign, media, and executive branch. this is a hundred watergates, and they're ignoring it. mainstream media credibility is forever destroyed. <eos> love to join but tonight is offspring and sublime... <eos> honestly, i'm beginning to love that tree-hugger. <eos> my sentiments exactly. a perk in maga! <eos> she knows hillary is corrupt and can peel voters away from her if she hammers it home. it's a winning solution for trump too. <eos> when the election is over, the green & red parties will be at peace. we may disagree on some issues but we both know the difference between right and wrong. <eos> jill supporters i met are much more reasonable than hillary supporters, and aren't complete assholes <eos> should trump offer stein the top epa job in exchange for her endorsement? that could be worth a couple percent <eos> get this to donald! we love our hippie grandma! <eos> no way she would give it to him. <eos> definitely <eos> not sure if she'd go for that. it doesn't appear that she wants to be a "sellout", and most of her supporters seem pretty far left, they wouldn't accept trump. i think it could ultimately hurt us if more supporters switch to hillary because muh refugees, muh green energy, muh climate change etc. than switch to trump. she might be more valuable as a third party, drawing some votes from hillary and former bernouts. that said, i like her. she seems pretty genuine and outspoken against hillary. that criticism alone is worth a ton in the current media climate. it's in our common interest to bring the establishment down, so any prominent voice out there fueling our righteous flame is welcome. <eos> my main gripe with trump is his energy stance. but he's pro coal so he can't come out as a conservationist. <eos> yeah, same here, but i understand his stance when a lot of coal miners desperately need the work. it's easy for me to criticize coal when my livelihood isn't dependent on it. <eos> wouldn't work. they are complete opposites when it comes to energy and environment <eos> trump wants more energy independence, and he said that would include more solar and wind. stein wants more solar and wind. seems like a win-win. <eos> but she is very opposed to nuclear energy. <eos> i don't really understand why, and i'm something of an environmentalist myself. compared to the the alternatives, it's very clean. chernobyl is often used as an example of what can go wrong, but the safety measures were deliberately turned off in order to run tests. <eos> she wants 100% renewable energy. i don't know much about the topic but it seems impossible to me, considering how inefficient it is. <eos> probably just not very informed on it. <eos> compromise. i feel like it would happen in a trump administration. <eos> how can you say that??? do you see how he talks? he is a sexual abuser! he only cares about himself! /s <eos> not a terrible idea if she could get over her nuclear fear. maybe have her meet with some engineers in that industry to explain that it's actually very safe (source: used to work in the nuclear industry as an engineer). <eos> there's a growing number of environmentalists that are pro-nuclear. <eos> there should be! watch "pandora's promise"! <eos> the left has such a boner for the french, but for some reason they don't talk about how the french have embraced nuclear energy <eos> power generation companies are deep into politicians' pockets. <eos> nuclear energy is honestly far superior than all other forms, less polluting than coal, less evasive (for same output) than wind farms and greater more efficient than most i wish australia would embrace it already, we have so fucking much nuclear material (the most in the world i believe) that we could be completely energy independent from other nations (assuming electric cars continue to take off as they have been here the past few years, thanks american telsa for leading the way away from oil!) <eos> not only do we have all the uranium we could want, we've got a vast uninhabited tectonically stable desert that we can both put plants in and store the waste. but nah, lets keep digging coal out of the ground aye <eos> and we could go into thorium as well. as long as we don't have ass our plants like the japanese did and build them on a fault line. <eos> i've said it so many times, we should build a few nuclear power stations 50-100km away from alice springs and fence up quarantine zones around them in the range of effected areas in case of a meltdown. this keeps them isolated, gives alice springs an economy to service and maintaince these power stations and it is also the [most central location in australia](https://i.sli.mg/cvntwd.gif). then run cables to states from these stations, they already have most south australian and all tasmanian power running from coal in victoria (which failed twice in the past year leaving 2 entire states without power due to ocean damage and flooding... alice springs doesn't flood) <eos> to be fair, tasmania got fucked because a ship ran over the basslink cable. they don't even need to be in alice. there are remote parts of pretty much every state that are perfect for nuclear power stations. even just one in every state would help us significantly. <eos> true this idea doesn't help tasmania too much because it would still require the basslink, they honestly need to be energy dependent of the mainland <eos> the sub of which we cannot speak has been shitting all over her. same thing a lot of republicans did to ron paul supporters and other libertarians who wouldn't vote for mccain or romney. <eos> it's not voldemort. gag orders in media - i invented that. it was me, robin. hoo hoo. <eos> well that's because she's a "spoiler." she clearly knows she can't win and is just running to take points away from the democrats, improving chances for a trump win. certainly not because she has a right to try for the throne and in the process use her platform to spark discussions about important issues. nah, she's just another anti-democrat tool and completely invalidated as a result despite being almost completely in-line with the left's policies. <eos> you mean r/redacted? *gets shot in the head* <eos> ruled a suicide. <eos> > the sub of which we cannot speak this like some harry potter level shit right now, like when the ministry of magic began tracking people who say voldemort <eos> shhhh <eos> here we have the ministry of meme magic <eos> memestry of maga <eos> ministress of fire tweets - the only fire that doesn't destroy forests. <eos> i strongly disagree with most of jill stein's views, but i do respect her for not bending the knee to hillary like bernie did. <eos> say what you will about her views but she has integrity! <eos> and a thick ass. <eos> jill stein dropping wind totems on twitter daily. <eos> hopefully her heroism isn't on cooldown when we get to the boss. (i want to say bloodlust but let's be honest, stein would be an alliance player) <eos> shes a shaman <eos> lol, is she a crystal healing nutjob? <eos> my sides <eos> i'm dead 💀💀💀💀👻👻👻👻 <eos> the most scary part of this is that in an hrc presidency the media would swipe under the rug every wrongdoings of the federal goverment. even the diehard hillary-suporter liberals that somehow justify that, they need to understand that the media does not do this for free. oh no, they are going to expect a lot in exchange for their services... bye bye net neutrality <eos> she should endorse trump <eos> she outright said the other day that trump is better than hillary. that's about as close to an endorsement of trump as you're going to get from someone like her. <eos> in the same quote she also said she did not want him to be president. so fuck her <eos> source? this could be huge to convert bernouts. <eos> http://www.usapoliticstoday.com/breaking-jill-stein-just-endorsed-donald-trump-watch-her-obliterate-hillary/ there are many other sources, but here's a random one. <eos> how do i block the "blockadblock" program through ublock? i understand that i *should* be giving these companies ad revenue, but i'm simply not willing to see adverts on any site, unless it's a youtube or twitch channel that i like a ton. <eos> she is a closet centipede at heart <eos> i would put my centipede in her... <eos> hollow fangs <eos> dude gross. <eos> not even she is a gilf. i can only hope that whoever my future wife is will look that good at her age. <eos> magic crystal plant grandma is so based. probably voting maga even though her name is on the ballot too. <eos> can you explain what based means in this context? i've been seeing it often and have been wondering. <eos> "the old lady who likes plants and believes in magic crystals is based." so she's a crazy hippie but, she often acknowledges the rigged system. <eos> based = righteous, epic, great, awesome. ronald reagan was seriously based. it's an internet vocabulary thing. <eos> thank you! <eos> yup, based essentially means kick-ass. you, my friend are based. <eos> #literally getting propped up, folks <eos> it's looking more and more like she is pushing her voters to trump. she doesn't want to see a clinton administration. <eos> she likes environment. war is bad for environment. makes sense that she'd prefer trump. <eos> while the means may be different, bernie and jill have many of the same goals at heart as trump... stop the f-ing over of 99% of americans and foolish foreign policies resulting from a rigged crony capitalism game. i don't think any of them are crazy... we can debate whose ideas are better later, but first let's expose and clean out current crony capitalist takeover of our media and government. <eos> she tried reaching out to him several times. they wanted to make him the green party candidate. <eos> all three are/were against the establishment. it would make sense for stein to endorse now, help clean things up, and then if she wants to run on her own platform later she'd have much better odds. <eos> she should leverage her way into a cabinet position now, and have another crack at potus in 2024. unless she's old as balls now? i haven't actually seen her age anywhere. <eos> jill's said a few times that hillary would be worse for the country (and world) than donald. probably as close to an endorsement as we'll see. as to bernie and jill supporters... i think donald could make some meaningful gains by amping up and hitting more squarely on ending our corrupt political system by ending the legalized bribery we currently have. i can say for myself, that might move me from not voting for hillary to voting for trump. <eos> based jill stein??? <eos> i disagree with much of the green party's platforms, but at least she's principled and seems to understand the big picture here. <eos> based, straight as an arrow, and not a cuck. <eos> yea, at this point its not just a slip. she has posted multiple tweets that indicate that clinton is much more dangerous than president trump. based! <eos> well, being donors isn't why they are propping her up. the question is what do they get from her for propping her up and donating bigly to her foundation. follow the money. <eos> #she forgets her duties but remembers her donors <eos> crazy socialist plant lady finally getting a clue <3 <eos> i wish crazy plant lady had powers like poison ivy from batman arkham knight. i'd like her to take out these goons rigging the election. <eos> literally the first comment on twitter tells her to "fall in line" ... assand this is how dictatorships are born. <eos> that guys comments are ridicuolous. at one point he says that trump complaining about election rigging is an attack on democracy. what a dipshit. <eos> "they're rigging the election by exposing how they rigged the election!" <eos> the corporations *need* hillary to get elected because at this point most of them have grown so powerful they have rampant and flagrant violations of american antitrust laws. <eos> the enemy of our enemy is our friend. i hereby dub her, jill steinipede. <eos> not always though <eos> auntipede <eos> plant lady must have finally grown a fire flower. she tossing fireballs left and right, destroying any goombas that get in her way. <eos> erecting demons is how they roll.. and lol! superbased plant lady! .. going nuclear on shillary! this is beautiful! <eos> she's officially gone rogue <eos> makes me wonder how many dems just fall in line because of funding <eos> i just gave her a little love reply to that tweet. <eos> if you had told me two years ago that the republican presidential candidate would be talking (and convincingly) about getting along with russia and peace in the middle east while the democratic candidate seemed all too eager to go to war with all the above, susan sarandon would call the democratic candidate "dangerous," and the second most sensible sounding candidate would be a crystal merchant grandma running for the green party, i'd have laughed at you. <eos> i may disagree with her on almost every issue but she is genuine <eos> this woman is bat shit crazy, but she's not wrong. <eos> a broken clock works twice a day <eos> greens use sundials not clocks <eos> i bet she is a beast in the sack. but she probably doesn't shave. <eos> probably correct on both counts. but i suspect she's post-menopausal. bring lube. <eos> jillybean should run in 8 years. i'd vote for her. <eos> over president ivanka? <eos> this is a given, but thank you anyway. <eos> between a green candidate with a fucking backbone, a libertarian that's against a free market and privacy rights, and a republican candidate with high energy, this might be the strangest election to date. <eos> is it too much to ask for a fair election? crooked hillary stole the nomination because she knows she can't win a presidential primary fairly (see 2008 with obama). now, she's trying to steal the general election for the presidency? it's so sad for our country. crooked has done so much to smear donald. the fake craigslist ads trying to pin him as a predator (see wikileaks), the collusion with the media, rigging the polls (her super pac pays for polls that manipulate the outcome to favor her, wsj and others use the data. also, influencing when polls are taken to get the worst possible result for trump, rather than using a consistent methodology), releasing that stupid tape, her "pied piper" strategy, and i could keep going. it really is a rigged system. <eos> i feel like she should jusy come out and endorse him. something like: "i appreciate all of my voters support, but i have come to realize that hillary is too dangerous for the future of our country. i will have many more chances to run in the future in less turbulent times, but i would encourage all those who want to vote for me to cast their ballot for trump to stop hillary. while trump and i don't agree on everything, hillary is a danger to the world." she's pretty much said all of it except for an explicit endorsement. <eos> **and** her campaign... <eos> the foundation *is* her campaign <eos> #what difference at this point does it make??? <eos> because they are pro big government liberals <eos> this lady is like gandalf the grey with an extra side of crazy. i love it. <eos> assange is gandalf. she's more like radaghast from the hobbit movie. crazy, and with a bird in his hair, but still pretty bad ass. <eos> you are absolutely right!!!!! get these wizards a fucking coat! <eos> why are they huge donors to her foundation? because, they get something in return. <eos> ironic that politico wrote it when politico is part of the media hilldog bought <eos> she needs a cabinet position... for trump. <eos> anti-shill jill is destroying all the shills on twitter. <eos> i think a lot of jill's voters will vote for trump as tribute. i think that is what she is trying say. don't waste your vote on me, there are more serious issues going on. <eos> she may not be great on much else but she's clued in corruption. maybe because she's not a lifelong politician. another plus <eos> give the plant lady a coat! she is slowly but surely coming over. <eos> the hate for hillary brings people together. its beautiful <eos> for someone so against nuclear, she sure has dropped h-bombs on crooked today! <eos> it has to do with corporatism & the obscene tax loophole promises clinton has made to the corporate media's lifeblood......advertising dollars. the corporate media networks know they cannot come out in opposition to clinton who is corporate welfare queen because their global tax/wage avoider advertisers will pull their ad dollars. these corporations are competing under capitalism where paying more in taxes & wages compared to a company in another low tax/slave wage country is a competitive disadvantage. ask yourself why fox a conservative channel for the most part is trashing the republican candidate for most of the day (with minor exceptions.) <eos> why can't this woman just swallow her pride, drop out, and endorse trump? <eos> yikes, no, every vote for her is a vote of someone who would have voted hillary. i know that's only a 1 vote swing, but let's not force them to hold their nose and vote for crooked. <eos> ## finally a mention about the cf... jack and jill went up a hill... stay safe... <eos> based hippie gilf <eos> you know, i kinda like this woman. glad she didn't get the democratic nod or trump might have lost. <eos> only if someone with half a brain was running against hitman hillary. <eos> trump, a billionaire businessman, has done more to help black americans than the first black president has. let that sink in. <eos> [removed] <eos> we suspect your post is a troll post. your post has been removed. *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/the_donald) if you have any questions or concerns.* <eos> [removed] <eos> he still believes that is true. lad <eos> first blackface president * <eos> hillary supporter: you can clearly see deep racism in that smile of his. <eos> straight white billionaire businessman damn trump good for you mr. president god emperor trump, good for you <eos> the left's denouncing of all businessmen as corrupt and sleazy is out of control. there's hundreds, thousands of millionaires and billionaires who has put in money, resources and their time to help out the everyday people in america. not to mention the rich pays a huge portion of the taxes to boot. it really is a shame that donald's positive work to the nation and especially the tri-state area near new york for 40+ years is being smeared nowadays. he has always been a modern hero of our time. <eos> they only demonize businesses until the democrats need money. i feel like clinton only plays left wing until she needs a donation, so she offers deals to corporations and banks and other countries to deregulate and/or favor them in exchange for campaign funds. <eos> but hillary rolls with hot sauce so it's a wash. <eos> [just wait here while i think](https://i.sli.mg/pmrlh9.jpg) <eos> > e businessman, has done more to help black americans than the first black president has. let that sink in. trump knew he was going to run for president, so he hid his racism by pretending to be not racist for 30 years!!! hahah. i kid i kid. <eos> just like he told all those "victims" to only bring it up if he ever ran for president. <eos> oh it sunk in awhile ago. <eos> the idea is down with the titanic. <eos> >two of the most prominent black figures in american history, **ever** >they give trump an award for helping minority communities. >trump is a racist. that's one hell of a thought process. if only i had the mental gymnastics training to navigate around rational thought like that. are rosa parks and ali...uncle toms? <eos> he also funded youth football and baseball leagues. <eos> can we get a list of these. this is a great one. there is also that video from the rainbow push coalition with jesse jackson. <eos> and al sharpton! <eos> omg drumpf is a black supremacist?

<eos> idk, but darn those racist high energy mods, deporting posts so quickly we cant laugh at them <eos> that's why he mentions the inner cities so much during the debates. he legit cares for the issues there and knows that fixing them fixes a fuck ton of problems <eos> and hillary and obama combined haven't done a single thing except make these communities more poor and more dangerous for everyone over the years. what have they got to lose, he can fix it! <eos> i can't believe the spin where the media says "but you said inner city african americans live in hell" what could that imply other than he's sympathetic of their situation and that the president hasn't done shit for it? <eos> especially when hardcore liberals are all talking about how shitty black people still have it and that they should even be payed back for slavery. then trump says that black people still live in hell and then all of sudden it's "but many african americans are rich and went to harvard an prosperous they aren't all living in slums you raaaacistt!!" <eos> msnbc " did trump inject muhammad ali and rosa parks with very slow acting poison at photo op? our twitter expert says yes". <eos> yeah and the thing i keep thinking to myself as a black male and i didn't grow up in inner cities, is that he's 100% right. black communities are decimated right now. any normal person doesn't think that what trump said is offensive. it's the truth. <eos> i'm a white chick, but i lived in a 99% black inner city for a while and he is absolutely right. it's hell in those places and they need help. nothing can get better until they admit it. <eos> that's before he was running for president so he wasn't a racist then. <eos> seriously. how they can call him the monster they do is beyond me. he's literally with rosa parks here. <eos> [removed] <eos> she's a politician that's her job. <eos> we suspect your post is a troll post. your post has been removed. *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/the_donald) if you have any questions or concerns.* <eos> where is the medal? <eos> rosa parks is an uncle tom. clearly <eos> "what a racist!" /sarcasm dnc did the same thing against bernie sanders who literally, physically marched with martin luther king jr. trump spent 30 years in the public light, never once called racist until he ran for president...how odd. <eos> he was actually called racist once before, some housing issue, i forget what it was but the people had poor credit, court cleared trump because race obviously wasn't the reason and that's all that happened :p <eos> #b-b-but muh racism <eos> can't you see him seething with racist rage? look at that smile, clearly he only did what he did so that in 2016 he could run for president and enact fascist racist policies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <eos> look he's taller than rosa parks! what a racist and misogynist! <eos> he's invading her space! rosa louise mccauley parks was an african american civil rights activist, whom the united states congress called "the first lady of civil rights" politifact truthometer: maybe true <eos> want to know who a man is?

(he's not) <eos> **look at how he's looking away from them. he hates being there! racist!!!** (these posts are probably confusing ctr... they're like... "hey boss do we vote these up or down??) <eos> why doesn't he bring this up more often or post this on twitter <eos> he's the owner of a billion dollar company and yet he's still humble as fuck. he doesn't brag about all the great things he's done. any rich person could have been a nice guy. he simply thinks that he's the man that america needs right now. a businessman who's built a multi billion dollar company from the ground up, who's not afraid to stand up for himself and the country, you'd have to wonder if those people even exist, and yet here he is. <eos> i'm confused. the media told me that trump is racist. <eos> if you have truly followed donald trump over the years, you will realize that he has been a giver over the years, sometimes spontaneously and without fanfare. why doesn't cnn showcase this? contrast this to the clintons, who have just taken over the years (they even stole artwork/artifacts when they left the whitehouse) and have only been generous with other people's money. how have the clintons have become multimillionaires? through a charitable foundation and living off the government teat. is it morally right to become filthy rich by saying you are helping others? if you say yes, you're corrupt. <eos> both hillary and bill clinton also received this same award. <eos> til rosa parks is white <eos> yeah this guy seems like a racist. lol people are cray. <eos> #the same youth that crooked called "superpredators" <eos> what are the medals for? <eos> [deleted] <eos> thanks fam <eos> does anyone know what medal this is? <eos> [removed] <eos> [deleted] <eos> awesome thank you! <eos> probably most racist white guy or something. source: buzzfeed. <eos> but... donald trump is racist against black people and muslims!!! this makes no sense!? <eos> are we still on the "trump is racist" thing? i thought they got over that... <eos> nice find! thank you, will pass along to some friends. <eos> presidential <eos> but he is a racist. (he is not) <eos> # r a c i s t ! <eos> damn, trump is old lolol doesn't look it though. <eos> yeah, i just saw that on cnn (nope). trump is a fucking racist!!!!! i had a wet dream last night that hillary had a fatal aneurism during the final debate. <eos> does anyone have any more info on this? maybe a speech at this event, some comments from parks or ali about trump's commitment, or anything like that? <eos> it's under accolades in wikipedia <eos> here's a ny times article from 1986 about it: http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/nyregion/80-named-as-recipients-of-ellis-island-awards.html <eos> look at that two racists putting that black guy in the back!! <eos> here's donald trump with rosa parks and muhammad ali receiving a medal for his work helping inner-city minority youth (1989) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cu06u_owiaaeo-k.jpg <eos> source? <eos> look at him making ali be in the back of the photo. what a racist. <eos> so racially he's pretty cool? <eos> all i see are three white males <eos> yes, but back then, trump wasn't running for president as a republican, so he was good (although rich and therefore not paying his fair share). now that he's running for president as a republican, against hillary clinton no less, he is bad. <eos> this needs to be at the top <eos> nah b he a raycis fuh that nigguhh <eos> why can't we see donald's hands? what is he doing to rosa??? <eos> why isn't this allowed on the msm? <eos> hilary got this medal too? <eos> rosa parks and muhammad ali both dead. coicenidience? <eos> this photo is from 1986, its the ellis island medal of honor and has nothing to do with helping inner city minority youth, which he may or may not have done. http://www.snopes.com/trump-received-ellis-island-award-in-1986/ <eos> what happened to ctr? i see shillposts on /pol all the time, but i'm starting to think it's more ironic shitposting than actual subversion. duodad do you think it's weird to see a real life cyberpunk red guard enacting some k. dick dystopia right here, right now? weird, eh? <eos> they're still there on pol, just propping up hypothetical ww3/nuclear-war-with-russia prep threads to slide important wikileaks exposure. <eos> crt usually not as active on the weekends. <eos> hillary was shilling for 25,000 dollar plates in seattle this weekend. i bet the coffers ran dry because they only have the support they pay for. they say on three things, 2 fake assault claims and 1 video proof that trump is a billionaire who didn't read a book most of us only did because we had to. ctr went back to playing words with friends, i guess. they'll be back shilling when their checks clear on monday or tuesday. <eos> its the weekend <eos> no dedication, just punching a clock <eos> its the (current year) <eos> ---^^------ this! <eos> i've seen a lot of strange stuff today. i saw a brilliant post on here with 1500+ points and scores of comments... blink back to 50 points and two comments. we should go asymmetrical and take the fight to them. <eos> that's something you can't expect from your regular hillbot. <eos> this is why hillary doesn't allow comments on her youtube page. shes gonna get her ass handed to her <eos> recruit ctr. you know how paranoid those guys have to be? if one of them flip, the rest are all going to prison. seriously, take the fight to them, find the first one to flip and give him immunity if he can take down david brock and the rest. <eos> occasionally i call them out on and essentially say if they are working for ctr, they are breaking the law, and when the ship goes down they will be in jail. what i do is pick one username in a thread and hit them with that message a few times. <eos> what are you saying they would go to prison for? <eos> they can be using illegal government toolkits in order to control and influence public opinion. they could be privy to damning secrets. also, their funding sources? knowing campaign collusion? also, what about if clinton foundation/campaign gets indicted in a rico case? i am not sure the reach of that, especially depends on if they are/were involved in any online harassment. <eos> conspiracy to commit treason . <eos> abraham lincoln never had to duck and dodge bosnian sniper fire. <eos> they could be tried for treason under trump's administration very easily, plus they broke many laws regarding the conduct of the fec, such as it being felonious to have a superpac such as correct the record working directly with a presidential campaign. <eos> this is the type of stuff i don't like being thrown around. i know we are all just shooting the shit here but people that are on the fence could read this stuff and take it as trump supporters being crazy. just finding reasons to imprison your opposition and their supporters is crazy. now going after hillary directly because she is a pos criminal that has broken many laws is one thing but to talk about going after people that supported her is as fascist as the shit we talk about the other side. fine them, disband them is cool and totally understandable but talking about throwing them in jail for posting some stuff on the internet is a completely different realm. fuck hillary and maga <eos> crazy? i don't think breaking laws and paying for doing so is crazy. neither is anything wrong with marking people who are complicit in getting a traitor into the white house traitors as well either, it's not like the shills are unaware of the danger they are putting themselves in you know, hillary wins, they'll be suicided by clinton's henchmen, if trump does, they'll get to sit in the supreme court, either way, they're fucked <eos> treason? that's too far - election laws though, yes. <eos> perhaps not by the "letter" of the law, but absolutely by the "spirit" of the law. those sonsabitches are knowingly, deliberately screwing over their own country to support hillary and disgrace our freedoms. <eos> i don't know. they are actively participating in the campaign to elect a person that knowingly used the state department to grant preferential treatment to our enemies. that sounds treasonous to me. <eos> disinformation propaganda for the corrupt candidate and what should be illegal collusion. fucking treason. <eos> you guys will have them dig in harder/double down with such a threat we will just forgive them (we won't) <eos> super pacs colluding with the campaign (as well as each other) is apparently illegal. look i don't even have a proper grip on what any of that truly means, but it's what people are saying. <eos> also i believe there an fec law that social media posts for a candidate has to have a disclaimer saying so. people paid to post on social media for a candidate can't do so anonymously/as unaffiliated <eos> basically creates the atmosphere for stuff like what hitler did with propaganda. the rules are there to prevent or reduce the chances of this happening. <eos> wow, i can't find a single positive comment on her fb page comments. perhaps we should share this with all our friends on facebook, something like: "dear friends, if you are considering to vote for hillary, or have already voted for her, please visit her fb page, and read the comments from her other fans. (insert link) <eos> spread it as if it were the gospel. <eos> too bad hillary can't remember her own password to get on facebook. she will have to wait for huma to log in. <eos> try runner4567. <eos> yes, her facebook is a riot ~ some great comments and info pointing out she is a liar/criminal. <eos> i've noticed that a ton of the people blasting her on fb are middle aged women. she is losing big with her biggest demographic right now. my own mother shits on hillary on her own feed all the time, and just this morning sent me an article about how all the groping accusations against trump are totally false, and said "i can't believe how obviously fake these scandals all are. how are they getting published?" <eos> my mom despises her. <eos> my mom hates her too. maga. <eos> my mom loves trump. she also shits on hillary in private. she's more conservative than i am and was happy to find out that her son is also on the trump train. <eos> your mom is a based centipede. <eos> trump 2016, he is going to win /u/legendarystickman! <eos> personally i believe the clinton campaign is running out of money. obama, gore, and michelle hate her, so i am sure they are, pardon the expression, raping her for speaking fees. they also appear to be doing big fundraisers left and right to try to backfill the coffers. many analysts have pointed out how many offices and staff they have in some states and how expensive that operation is. meanwhile by comparison trump has armies of volunteers and the enthusiasm slows his "burn through rate" with viral and free passionate support. in summary, it gets expensive paying all your speakers, your fake audiences, the video ads 370k people watch on facebook with only a couple hundred shares and 7k likes (mostly paid), paying off the media, etc. this is a house of cards and the maga sledgehammer is coming down right on top of it! <eos> but, but, but..... trump said 'pussy'. but hey, kanye west, right? [intro: kanye west] this that rap god shit nigga i rip every one of these mothafuckas down aye rah, rah, rah rah, rah [verse: kanye west] closed eyes, see things fire up, tweaking you in my freak dreams you in my freak dreams bad bitch, you dig that get stacks, drive cars whip out, bitch out tits out, oh shit my dick out, can she suck it right now?

<eos> pathetic losers <eos> most hated woman in america & i bet the entire world! <eos> her facebook is full of these trumps is not she has 7 million likes. trump has 11 million. her sub has 30,000 we have 230,000 trump fills arenas. hillary can't fill a high school gym. but she's supposed to be winning? <eos> my fav comment on hillary's page: >i'm sick and tired of those who say hillary has no great accomplishments. i would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is a great accomplishment. <eos> kek <eos> and they say trump is savage. don't mess with the patriots or you will get stumped. maga! <eos> holy crap, just checked it, and she is getting lit up. maga! <eos> trump has 3 million more followers on twitter and 4 million more on facebook. most of the comments on her facebook are calling her a criminal, "needy latinos" and other comments related to wikileaks. the only thing she is actually winning in are the rigged polls reported by her msm surrogates. that combined with the sudden accusers coming forward (decades later when trump is running for president no less) tells me they are really desperate. **maybe hillary isn't sick. maybe she's just hiding her face in shame. :)** #\#maga <eos> ah ha! first response i got back: "band of bullies" <eos> airhorn! https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=grrdgrpopnw maga <eos> the smile on that lady in the first comment followed by the comment is perfect. <eos> the first time in months i have left r/ponyang with plus karma i thought it was weird. they are probably scared over the leaks,they might have closed down the operation ,too much info out there about them. might i suggest that we don't test this theory we dont want to piss the mods off after yesterday's shitshow. <eos> my favorite part of hillary's tweets is that they have to make her reply 10 times to her own tweets in order to block out all of the people calling her out for being a phony liar and linking to wikileaks. <eos> the bottom reply in the screenshot about lincoln and clinton is just savage <eos> oh what a day...what a lovely day :p f.u shillary <eos> holy shit you're right... https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/ <eos> one ctr fucker could flip and be a hero. <eos> idk if that lincoln comparison has been used already, but that's my first time seeing it and it's great <eos> its like this on everything she posts there lol <eos> wew! reading the comments on all of her facebook posts gives me hope that this country is moving in the right direction, you know, the direction opposite of hillary. <eos> that last comment is false. she was under sniper fire that one time she was abroad saving babies from aids. <eos> yup i've been slipping in and out of hillary's facebook and it's an absolute shit-show. bernie's page is a mess as well and the comments of cnn videos on youtube are a lynching. <eos> don't forget her book reviews on amazon! <eos> this should be top kek. <eos> hillary fb = pure festival of hate <eos> its a shot show of hillary hate over there. it get my maga chubby harder <eos> feminist bitch got owned <eos> i hit her fb page daily with negative comments. everyone should do the same. only takes a minute. show the shills our power. <eos> that second guy had a good fuckin point. well said. <eos> i do some of my best trolling on facespace <eos> donald trump is risking himself to save the us. hillary is risking the us to save herself. there's your stinger. <eos> so...is there anything that can be done about the msm organizations who have mislead and, in my own opinion, obstructed justice by their actions? (they might not have met the legal def. of obstruction, but fuckin' a, they know how to lie) yes, there are constitutional protections for journalists, but what about lying to the public? breaking fec laws? i'd love to see the top sonsabitches who run cnn, etc, get dragged into court and then thrown out in the street like the bums they fucking are. <eos> so, a lot of these comments don't seem to be from real people. but the likes appear to be. <eos> what were they doing with the candles? <eos> i live trump speeches. feeling good again. <eos> lol, the chicken tendies <eos> opening act https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-nlph8jem <eos> https://i.redd.it/ddg8h654w5ix.jpg kek <eos> you know, for all the pandering politicians do about "race", everyone has always ignored indian americans. trump is the first one to actually acknowledge and care about all of us together. i feel he deals in action and decisions, so color doesnt matter to him. shit just needs to get done, and thats why i like him. ive read his books growing up and not once does he throw shade at some group, and most importantly he doesn't apologize for being white. he's made an effort to reach out to everyone and hasn't diminished his own background while doing it. maga trump, we're behind you! <eos> true! i think a lot of it is growing up in new york, where race isn't a big deal unless you're a lib dealing in identity politricks. <eos> that putin in the corner is killing me, hahaha. <eos> add them to the list of people she disrespects. so far we have: half the republicans, christians, latino taco bowls, black superpredators that should be brought to heel, rape and sexual assault victims, basement dwelling bernie supporters... am i missing any of them? on her respect list we have: illegal immigrants, saudi human rights violators, wealthy corporations, a kkk mentor, child rapists, a rapist she's married to, and huma. <eos> fucking lmao just pin a stream full of cartoons and memes. <eos> but trump is so racist. that's impossible he would be holding his 3rd rally of the day at a hindu event. while (c)linton rests up at home until the debate. but she's fit as a fiddle and has energy for days. lmao <eos> [removed] <eos> i'm a hindu - what's silly here? <eos> as an indian, i approve. also it is not the just about indian immigrants, it is about all of the americans. together. stronger. fighting against evil. making america great again. <eos> dude, this is my hometown! i'm fairly certain he's the only presidential candidate in, like, history to visit little ol' edison, nj. maga! <eos> **gate-busting love** **can't stump won't stump** <eos> lmao these cartoons floating around the screen <eos> so what does an indian think after reading reader comments on stories like these, publicized on breitbart - by now everyone should know the ties between them and trump [breitbart loves you](http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/06/indian-police-bust-massive-operation-preyed-u-s-taxpayers-scam-irs-phone-calls/#disqus_thread) <eos> what are you asking? love trump, love america, love that india and usa can be good allies. <eos> wtf is going on with the random jpgs and gifs being pasted all over? <eos> it's live satellite news. they do this all the time. they're the ones that have a dancing putin in a tux. <eos> just seems a bit rude to cover up the front of the podium, whatever. <eos> memes, bud. keep up <eos> add generation <eos> this stream looks so old school. thought this was 70's trump <eos> shubh raatri, centipedes! <eos> you're watching live satellite news <eos> we have the best pooja don't we? <eos> hahahahaha my sides <eos> you're watching live satellite news <eos> that was actually pretty good :) <eos> meanwhile hillary is no where to be seen...where the fuck are you hillary? <eos> really <eos> thank vishnu we're finally recognizing **india**, *a country of 1.2 billion people*, as a global superpower. one that we should work with because their values are similar to that of ours. <eos> india is pretty awesome, they hate islamic terrorism. they get it. <eos> china y u help pakistan? <eos> values being similar is actually false. its just a modern misalignment of views. <eos> how so? i'm intrigued and i want to know more. <eos> especially since their military power is built on russian assets! we really need to start mending fences instead of what killary wants to do to us. <eos> dudes a beast <eos> i never thought my mom could be converted (she literally believes in communism), but the madman fucking did it. i guess pandering to indians does work. <eos> this is some bullshit man. my parents would never "convert". no amount of pandering from trump will make up for himself. <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiimj9tuc8 [intensifies] <eos> i am loving this speech! i literally cannot remember the last time anything out of clinton's mouth wasn't about how "terrible" trump is. does she actually have any worthwhile ideas about anything? <eos> i think she just goes with whatever improves the 'polls' and they found out that when she tries to talk policy nobody believes her and she comes off as shrill and off putting. so her advisors told her to stick to mindlessly bashing trump because it's the only thing that helps <eos> > she comes off as shrill and off putting because she is...? i mean, just saying what we all already know... <eos> i love trump even more now. i didn't think that was possible. <eos> trump just threw pakistan under the bus. which he should, as they gave bin ladin haven. <eos> makes sense, indians are generally totally based because they dislike pakistan/islam. <eos> yeah a real president would never do that. he is totally pandering to the audience because indians and pakistanis don't have good relations in their lands. as much as you're right about the pakastani people giving osama haven, it doesn't makeup for being rude <eos> what the fuck?! i thought god emperor was going to rest until monday. jokes on me, thinking he needs rest. <eos> "and on the seventh day, he made america great again" <eos> why is apu floating around? <eos> because apu is hindu, duh. <eos> oh yeah because this all isn't offensive <eos> just a tradition. we like fire <eos> the god of memes. <eos> "i am become pepe, the kek of all memes." <eos> oh yeah this is definitely appropriate ... <eos> indians are basically fucking white males because they figured out the dark, evil secret of how we got all our privilege: 1. have kids later in life. 2. stay married to your partner rather than letting them raise kids alone. 3. actually hound your kids to succeed in school. 4. prioritize education and starting businesses over having the latest cars or clothes. 5. pool family resources together to make sure nobody gets left behind. 6. make your communities wholesome, supportive places to live by not perpetrating crime or violence on one another. because they found out our secret, they can't be controlled with the pitiful promise of hand-outs and relaxing policing standards in their communities. dems have nothing else to offer. <eos> lol shh dont tell people the secret. delet dis. <eos> > prioritize education and starting businesses over having the latest cars [...] hey, hold up now. <eos> preach!!!!!!!!!!! <eos> yep. have you ever seen a homeless indian on the street in the united states? i haven't. <eos> taking one out gabriel iglesias's book <eos> damn son, i never even thought about that before you said it. *mind blown* <eos> #delete this <eos> you're a white....oh wait. you're a smart male! <eos> it's because indians and asian americans thrive based on most metrics while blacks and hispanics do not <eos> he deals with actions and decisions that aren't too great. one thing about him is that he is insanely childish or creepy. very much like an african dictator. of course his books dont throw shade at people because he doesn't write his books. i would argue that color and race matters to him very much. i would say he would be making 7/11 jokes but he is so out of touch with america, he probably doesn't know where indian people are. his people are just trying to get to all groups of people because they know he needs to reach out to actually have an effect because he is incredibly rude and not presidential <eos> make vishnu great again! <eos> fuck off <eos> not sure if the american right loves you back.... [the way the breitbart crowd views you](http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/10/06/indian-police-bust-massive-operation-preyed-u-s-taxpayers-scam-irs-phone-calls/#disqus_thread) <eos> we have the highest energy, don't we folks? the best energy! <eos> man of the people am i right ! <eos> buy pepe <eos> this made my night <eos> but trump could totally keep it up for 3 hours. <eos> #based hindus <eos> well there is a difference between islam and muslim, but anyone who supports sharia law can go fuck themselves. that is my opinion. <eos> yes, and i think it's a great play. we'll see if it pans out, but i'm hopeful, given the polling in nj. <eos> this event needs some sort of twitter hashtag. <eos> i'm from there - edison is a huge community of hundreds of thousands, i'm guessing. if he wins them over (which i think he can) it's a great boost to his chances in nj. <eos> i was hoping this would tie into the grand kek prophecy. <eos> that's what people don't seem to understand. it's not because they're brown or have a hard time speaking english, it's because they choose not to become american. these people, they're americans. <eos> where in nj was the event? <eos> i wasn't there so i don't know. someone posted that on 4chan and i thought it was very cool. sorry <eos> we have the best nuclear families. <eos> that is hilarious! is he one of our 'pedes? <eos> loved it. plus the food adverts lol <eos> perfect lol <eos> that's how sikhs happened. <eos> if i were a billionaire, my bodyguards would all be sikhs. <eos> #3 rallies #3 states #1 trump <eos> yup i had to unidentified race choose not to report to get my full ride, see women and other races get scholarships when i grew up poorer, (wasn't poorer, my family just cheap lol) <eos> i didn't even know it was a thing at the time, so when i applied to schools, i just put down asian. tremendous mistake, i only got into one school i wanted, and i know that school doesn't do affirmative action. i was so lucky my dad is very successful and was able/willing to pay for my college, and so i ended up doing very well with no debt. only scholarship i got was $1000 from a local foundation because i was my high school's valedictorian. <eos> wait are indian americans not pricks like in canada they are entitled refuse to learn english and have some of the worst social habits like trying to get services for free or refusing to pay service people <eos> i eman we cheap fuckers it's why we successful, my mom still barely knows english after living in america 30 years, my dad fully assimilated and says all sorts of american sayings <eos> then fuck yoy and your parents ive been called racist because i wouldnt shave the bill half off or give 200 dollar products for free. <eos> tbh i feel its also the type of indians that left india to come to united states and canada. for canada, a lot of the early indian immigrants were farmers who are not well off in india. but in the states, it was mostly engineers who wanted to get a better education. but like /u/dylan522p says, we cheap and we proud. <eos> my grandpa went to kenya cause he was a poor farmer, he became very rich until his estate got raided by tribesmen, he had to flee with my father and his brother when they were 3 and 1, then he went to india and was in diamond business until it crashed, became poor farmer again then he moved to america they were not educated, only to age of 16 that is <eos> well then we we will have to make the wall 10 feet higher! <eos> #don't talk to me or my wall ever again [trump's wall just got 10 feet higher! *high energy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qligom24qqc) #total height: 241070ft. we are 80.356% of the distance of hillary's emails if we had 10ft for each one (300000ft)! 58930ft remaining. ***** bot by /u\/tonysesek556 - [about page](https://aws.wariomissed.com/thewallgrows/) - **[taking suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbt77un01wxb3opvwc8llesd1e8jqj5mnkhitd4qqqk/viewform)** - /r/the_donald ***** if you don't want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you, please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist! <eos> #welcome back based bot <eos> 10 feet higher edit: fucking love it <eos> #help! i've fallen and i just got stumped by trump.

thank you so much and get these people heard and put in action! <eos> what i appreciate about hannity is that he doesn't pretend to be a "journalist" like all the left-wing reporters supporting hillary. in his fox bio, wikipedia, and podcast introduction, he identifies himself as a conservative political commentator. i get agitated when i hear all these left-wing journo frauds defend their advocacy for hillary by suggesting we have rush and hannity. <eos> i used to hate hannity because i felt he was a huge gop establishment cuck. however, he's been the only guy at fox not cucked this election. i gotta give him credit for his fair trump coverage and the fact that he actually discusses shit like wikileaks. i used to like beck because at one time he was anti-establishment, but it was all an act. beck is as cucked as it can get. <eos> i think at the beginning of the primary he supported the sleepy doctor <eos> i was sad when it was over. how i wish the cucked and deceived supporters could see this. sad. <eos> fuck the media blackout. i didn't realize we lived in the prc. <eos> the silly images on the screen. this is mocking trump. can't believe people haven't stumbled across this bullshit channel on youtube. they are basically a parody of rightside broadcasting network. youtube tries to cover up rightside with this silly parody bullshit channel. this makes trump look bad. <eos> indians shouldn't be that ignorant and pandering and saying things specifically like this is taking advantage of people because of their fears from india. that is wrong by all means. trump doesn't have all of the hindu vote. trump is a jackass that has it coming to him <eos> yesss ... 10 feet higher <eos> #this wall could go up in smoke but it shall never bern [trump's wall just got 10 feet higher!

(lol cnn)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyjpkk_drxo) <eos> even if she's voting for hillary. she is a true hero and a patriot. i truly respect her for standing up for her values against the influence of the corrupt government. <eos> respect to phil for not only turning it down, but also informing us about it and saying it's not his place to tell us how to vote. <eos> oh man, i hope his life won't be in any danger from this. <eos> i have no idea who this guy is - 'youtube community' stuff is not my thing - but i absolutely salute and respect him for his honesty here. <eos> if you could say a shithole like youtube had glory days, he was one of the most popular vlog/jumpcut news channels in 2008 or so when the site was admittedly at its best. he has continued to stay aboard the sinking ship as a, i guess, last vestige of his era where not everything felt like an ad/cash grab. <eos> even though phillyd won't vote for trump i respect him. he at least is trying to face reality head on and figure shit out. and he brings the lulz <eos> yeah, i like phillyd. he does daily videos on current events, and he isn't completely retarded. i watch him on weekdays, but i don't care for his weekend shows. <eos> he used to go out of his way to find the "middle ground" on a lot of issues, and it was annoyingly obvious. that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. maybe he finally got that "fuck you" level of money. <eos> i get the feeling he's very nearly in the same "basket" as many of us. labelled with the left's favourite adjectives for taking reasonable positions on social issues. you can only put up with it for so long before you say "fuck it". <eos> i quit visiting his channel about 6 years ago when he started with misleading thumbnails and just covering whatever was on reddits frontpage, but since then he has definitely started showing opinions rather than laying out the basics and encouraging people to fill in the blanks. <eos> wouldn't be surprised to find out that the youtubers are not the only ones being paid to endorse hillary <eos> they pay people to shill on wow. <eos> wonder how many reddit admins are in her pocket too. that sub that shall not be mentioned is 100% for hillary. that sub that's suppose to be neutral grounds. not a single pro trump link considering all the times this sub has reached the front page. <eos> i'm 100% certain that broke ass schwarzenegger got paid to go against god emperor after the tapes fiasco. dude is doing app commercials. <eos> if it wasn't for trump he wouldn't have a ready made hit show, the apprentice, to take over. <eos> those commercials are basically right out of the critic too. <eos> the podesta emails showed correspondance with caa, the biggest talent agency and whom rep the majority of a-listers. <eos> not surprised, also would not be surprised to learn of monetary payments to reporters and supposed news people <eos> i support hillary clinton ^^for ^^prison <eos> # w^e^w^l^a^d <eos> that's fucking pathetic. <eos> might even be illegal. it's against the law to pay for votes and isn't that essentially what an endorsement is? <eos> it would also be illegal to have a paid opinion in a video without it being said <eos> i may be wrong but i think that only counts for corporate endorsement <eos> which is illegal, correct? <eos> depends. the youtuber could illegally be doing it if they are getting paid and dont state they were paid for that opinion <eos> via podesta emails hillary has been coordinating with pacs that will go out and do this so yes <eos> only if it was her actual campaign. i'm sure it was just an unaffiliated pac that just happens to be endorsing clinton. <eos> "unaffiliated" <eos> ''''''''unaffiliated'''''''' <eos> so this is why companies are legally people now. protected by the first amendment when beforehand we could tell them to fuckin knock that shit off. what i want to know is who profited from the pizza = vegetable thing, and what the fuck!? <eos> phil is an og youtuber. i have some tremendous respect for him saying what he did. since he's in a highly visible position it's not his place to comment. fantastic stuff, good for him. <eos> why? i thought she's got this in the bag! <eos> i heard ann coulter use that argument on bill maher and i do say it makes a good point. why would clinton be fighting tooth and nail on this campaign if it were as clear cut as polls make it seem? <eos> that explains the sudden casey nistate video of him endorsing hillary from 3 days ago... also, i love philip dafranko, been watching his shit since 2009. hes so unbiased and in the middle, hes the type of reporters we need on tv <eos> no shit. he usually never gets political on his videos and then all of a sudden a 2 min long video. all the stuff he said about trump was msm to the t. this would make perfect sense. he seems like a guy who would do his research and if he did he might not love trump but he would definitely be disgusted and unsupportive of hilary. <eos> big thread about it right here https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/570t40/shill_if_you_upvote_this_post_casey_niestat_will/? <eos> ahhh thank you kind sir. <eos> a guy i work with watches casey's videos every morning before he starts work. i saw one he was watching once. for the life of me couldn't understand the appeal. he spends his time walking around with a selfie stick in nyc, showing off his video editing equipment, dicking around on a motorized skateboard, doing "something" with his wife and kid and then promoting some luxury item some company gave him for free. don't see what's so riveting that he has 500k subscribers <eos> i can sadly say i use to enjoy watching him. until he joined samsung. he use to always talk up his iphones and what not and then cut a deal with samsung and always has videos with samsung shit. it's not about the phones or any of that. it's about he is being bought out. he promotes what gives him money. he use to do a thing called mail time also and he stopped doing that because company's sent him tons of shit and he didn't want to show it. my guess is one free item isn't worth it to him. he wants cash money. edit: over 5 million subscribers. just looked. wow. <eos> she'll pay for endorsements? i'd love to take her cash, donate it to a charity in my local area, then vote trump. <eos> not donating her money to the trump campaign. come on, fam <eos> helping people in need in my local area isn't in trump's message? my bad fam... <eos> trump would want you to take the money and do what's best for america. <eos> the underlying theme here is trump! <eos> aren't they required to disclose that they received payment for their endorsement, or have federal election laws just gone out the window this year? <eos> if its from a superpac, then no. <eos> so a super pac can literally pay people to vote for and publicly endorse a candidate without disclosing it? <eos> ironically, colbert covered this last election because you know, republicans were doing it. now though, he's super silent <eos> lets see... hillary paid people to show up at her nomination and cheer, hillary paid people to protest trump, hillary paid people to show up at her rally, hillary paid people to endorse her. i honestly wouldn't be surprised if the poll numbers are somewhere 70% trump 20% hilldog <eos> why aren't i fifty points ahead you might ask ?! i'm not that rich ! <eos> all that money we gave bernie is coming back around now isn't it <eos> it's an all out propaganda war. democratic party = fascist. <eos> those whores would endorse the original hitler if they got paid. <eos> "you know, he wasn't really a bad guy! he loved animals! let's be nazi's" - youtube ironic, considering that regressivism is the road to totalitarian government control. <eos> is that why that fetal alcohol syndrome looking youtuber made that pro-hillary video? (it is) <eos> poor man's sean penn <eos> that makes so much sense. i've seen a bunch of douchey youtubers supporting hillary on twitter. i kept thinking, why do these people suddenly care about this election. <eos> [streamable mirror](https://streamable.com/pgne) ___ i'm a bot. if you have any suggestions you can message my creator here:

<eos> on the last podcast barbara mentioned that people aren't voting for hilary just because she's a woman. and gavin has been saying some really stupid stuff regarding politics. it's getting really hard to watch their content given their political ignorance. <eos> thats surprising considering she was really anti pc for the most part. <eos> i really enjoyed their podcast but hopped off a while back because the new crew of young kids is retarded. having my other podcasts turn into cuckfests, i've been afraid to go back and catch up with the rt podcast, fearing that even the older guys (bernie, gus, joel, mat,) would be austinite brainwashed liberals. geoff is already a druggy loser, he was so funny, but last thing i need is that burnout talking politics. also all their other content outside the podcast is really bad, and not funny. it's really childish shit. especially this new video going around where some fat hipster axe kicks a desk with $1500+ worth of equipment and it drops on the floor breaking. it's just childish entitled 90s skateboarder trash retard lvl shit. really all the podcasts i enjoy lately have turned into fucking cuck shows. comedy button became a pc step lightly bitch program that use to say whatever the duck they wanted, a few others just showed themselves to be ignorant uninformed morons. really really sucks. i don't want political podcasts, i just want some funny ones to pass the time at work, that aren't a cast full of idiots and pc pussies. joe rogan experience is still decent, i'm behind, but he at least shits on everyone, and isn't a pussy in other aspects of his life. <eos> yup. rooster teeth has become pretty rough. barbara is completely brainwashed. she mentioned that she thought people weren't voting for hillary because she's a woman at one point. gavin often spouts off stuff that is completely false and has been completely trashing trump based on completely bs news. at least gus and bernie don't get too political. i don't mind them talking a little bit of politics, just don't talk about it in a way that calls everyone they disagree with idiots. i also was trying to get into giant bomb's podcast, but on one of their recent ones they went on a whole trump tirade about some completely bs news stories. <eos> yeah i enjoyed barbara and gavin for their humor and stupidity, but neither of them is very smart. especially gavin, he is a brainwashed u.k. moron. afraid of guns, wants government cameras on every corner, doesn't appreciate freedom. glad to hear gus and bernie keep it real, they are the best part of that whole damn company. the giant bomb podcast gets a lot of love on the internet, but i tried them a few times and they are just really dry grumpy bastards with white knight m'lady tendencies. <eos> i havent watched their stuff in a few months. have they been really biased? <eos> they've been shitting on trump for months. not so much recently, but they were obviously pushing an agenda a month or so ago. it's a shame, i was considering getting a first membership. sure as fuck won't now. <eos> i still enjoy a lot of their stuff, but i imagine its hard for them to not support hillary because they're based in austin. i imagine a lot of them are probably gonna vote trump. <eos> i know gavin doesn't like him but that is to be expected since he was against brexit. <eos> he talks crap about trump, but he doesn't really know anything about what's going on in politics. i remember during the last election, he said he wanted to be able to vote for obama because he thought it was cool there was a video of him singing. like...wtf?! <eos> i knew that sellout who did a video last week was a sellout. casey whatever. he was asking other youtubers to do the same, fuck that shill. <eos> he's sold out before to samsung, emirates, boosted boards, and tons of other companies. <eos> i fucking knew it. people who spend years never getting involved in politics suddenly making these videos. yt has a ton of trump support so making a video like this is a terrible career decision unless you're getting something for it. and some of these youtubers are smart people giving the absolute dumbest arguments for their support. its fine by me if someone supports hillary but i knew something was off. <eos> it'd just be one more reason to hate pewdiepie. this would be suicide for the youtubers. if gamer gate taught anyone anything, it's that millenials who hang out on the internet all day are redpilled af. they'd see through it without blinking. <eos> but..but..but trump is the desperate one am i right shills? <eos> good for him, hopefully he doesn't succumb to fever induced bullet wound <eos> this would've been first on my to do list. i would've bribed stefan molyneux, scott adams, ramzpaul, sargon of akaad, roosh, tommy sotomayor, info wars, black pigeon and a whole bunch of other people out there. these are the ones that make a difference and then we ,the viewer, pass this information along in the comments section of the many internet forums that are out there. <eos> that's why hipster mcdouchebag did it. <eos> [base goddess lauren southern said this about a month ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnnou0hhqvy&t). <eos> i would support hillary for money. that would be my "public" position. my "private" position would be supporting trump. <eos> i don't watch phil much but over the last few months i have, and i really respect him for staying neutral about the election as a public figure. which is how the media should be, but of course, they aren't. however that one guy that came out as a hillary supporter and tried to start a witch hunt for youtubers to come out as hillary supporters is a little bitch. <eos> i've been unsubbing to all youtubers that have been getting political. the issue is that they always state their position as though they are 100% correct and that everyone who disagrees is an idiot. lately, rooster teeth podcasts have been getting a bit too political for my taste. <eos> clinton: "what's that trendy web-place where people show cat videos?" huma: "youtube?" clinton: "don't call me a tube you filthy muslim piece of snatch! just find that web-place and get me some followings there!" <eos> this is sad and disgusting. <eos> if you take the money, i recommend you make them to pay you in advance. <eos> just because she pays them doesn't mean they will actually vote for her. <eos> it's more about getting "role models" to endorse her so that people who look up to them will vote for her <eos> that's why the katy perry/madonna/miley cyrus angle <eos> we should get to them, and ask them to endorse trump for free. <eos> based defranco? <eos> shocking <eos> big surprise. celebrities have been political tools for half a century. riiiight around the time the soviets infiltrated us. <eos> in b4 massive msm hitpiece campaign on this guy featuring rigorous "research" by ny times <eos> she will refuse to attend <eos> she wants mandatory drug testing on our kids, but won't take one herself. <eos> fuckin bern! ... i mean burn! brilliant, btw. <eos> she thinks the marijuanas are lethal <eos> (it isn't) <eos> if i have to take a piss test for work why can't she? <eos> the constitution does not require one. <eos> rules, laws, and regulations don't apply to a clinton. didn't you know this? <eos> thats why we need to lock her up! <eos> even if she does a drug test, what difference will it make? the results will be rigged! <eos> i'm worried that they would alter donald's to show him positive for something. i wouldn't put it past them. <eos> exactly. it's a lose lose for her no matter what <eos> if obama and congress made such a huge fuss about baseball players and steroids, then i don't see what's outlandish calling for the same for a presidential debate. <eos> have you seen the top post on /r/[redacted]? they say that trump asking for a drug test before the debate is proof he does coccaine. u hwat? <eos> howard dean accused trump of using cocaine. put your fucking money where your mouth (piece) is hillary! http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/09/30/howard-dean-dont-know-trump-never-used-cocaine/ <eos> we need olympic style tests with hair and nails that go back years!! <eos> i'm talking using [spinal taps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaxzzhm8zlw), dawg. <eos> hair and nail tests dont go back years though. <eos> there are many sources but here [the test will detect up to a year] (http://www.asuretest.com/nail.php) with hair or nail. at any rate it is much better than a pee test. <eos> nah, she will rig the test then <eos> hillary is buzzed on embalming fluid <eos> you guys are not going to like what scott's current thoughts are on the state of the election... and you people swearing off him instantly because of that are showing some serious signs of cognitive dissonance. just trying to stay unbiased here. <eos> there is no point in watching scott anymore. his periscopes are now super depressing where he outlines why trump is finished. it's just not exciting perhaps he has not looked at the specifics of all the cases that have come forward. he thinks half of them are true. if you constantly hedge your bets and change your predictions at any given point you are no longer predicting the future only reacting to the present. we have never seen an election like this and there is no way to predict the future. i would say that scott adams description of trump of the hero, donald trump mimicking the rise and fall of a hero, and our view of trump of the hero is not a coincidence. before engaging adams or trump's first major "gaffe" or fall i saw him as a political hero. it is only fitting that the hero's greatest challenge looks bleak to all the others. the race has been plunged into chaos (praise kek). it always darkest before the don. <eos> there's only 3 weeks left, dance with the girl that brung ya. he's hedging so either way he's right, which is a bitch move. <eos> well he addressed this directly, said it would be pretty stupid to not re-assess things when given new details. <eos> "i bet on carolina but now that denver is leading with 2 minutes left, i gotta say, i'm changing my prediction." ~two weeks later~ "remember how i totally predicted the super bowl guys?" <eos> bahahaha this fucking son of a cuck gets it. stay away from scott adams. no backboned bitch. <eos> cognitive dissonance. <eos> y'all, please refuse to be the sheeple y'all bitch about. adams is a humorist, he is a professional "smoke-screener." you have no idea truly why he says what he says (he designs it that way), and for all you know, he realized that coming out and saying "trump has lost" actually galvanizes us more to vote for trump. or, trump really is in this huge massive hole and adams is right. i'm 20 years old and man it's hard to find many young women my age who openly support trump. down in my generation, soooo many girls are hostile to men. and trump is exactly what they hate. but i don't blame them because in this education system, we're propogandized to the max. <eos> [removed] <eos> tl;dr: scott adams is a cuck. edit: every downvote = 1 cuck who cried when scott adams said trump was going to lose. <eos> you know those vicious 300 pound blue haired feminists that want to castrate and murder trump supporters? i don't think he wants any part of that shit. it's so obvious he supports trump though. <eos> this is interesting http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04br13j?ocid=socialflow_twitter <eos> of course, hes covering his own ass. still voting for trump though. <eos> > publicly believes the victims he never even said that though. he said it doesn't matter at all whether they're true or not. <eos> publicly is definitely the key word there. earlier today while deep into one of his periscope videos though, he said this: ["the odds of all trump's accusers being wrong is way higher than you think."](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottadamssays/comments/57om4r/scott_adams_on_periscope_the_odds_of_all_trumps/?st=iubt6yn0&sh=3f806a53) <eos> yeah 40% was pretty shocking to me. was also very intriguing how he says we there will never be a male president again. i'm glad i'm not american right now because this is all depressing as fuck even as a canadian. i really hope you guys pull this off somehow. <eos> makes sense. if this works, you can do this to any male running for president from now on, and there's no chance they can win. so if you want to win, you have to run a woman. <eos> he hasn't really turned on trump though. he literally said this on periscope today: ["anybody who votes for hillary clinton is fuckin' dead to me."](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottadamssays/comments/57ohqu/scott_adams_on_periscope_anybody_who_votes_for/?st=iubs3wrh&sh=b381cff7) <eos> whats timestamp? <eos> didn't write it down, but it's near halfway through. <eos> it will be rigged just like every thing else she does. then she will come out and say look how crazy trump is, you can't trust him. you can't fight the battles against her where she can set the rules. <eos> it's too late for scott, he already cucked out over this stupid avalanche of unproven sec allegations, you should stay away from that guy, fellow pede. he's served his purpose and can now be purged. <eos> what did he say <eos> he said in a recent blog post that the sexual assault allegations against trump meant it was over for him and hillary will win easily. i think he overreacted to that. sure, the allegations have hurt trump, but i don't think they've hurt him so badly that he'll lose the election. he's still gaining in the polls and people are really starting to catch on to the bullshit. <eos> besides, monday isn't here yet! <eos> he's probably worried his "trump will win in a landslide 100%" prediction won't come true so he's back pedaling a bit. <eos> he basically said the fake allegations sealed the deal for hillary, but the blog post was full of "if" and "unless" so hes clearly still for trump. hes just covering his own ass. <eos> people say that like its a bad thing... is there a problem with covering your own ass? certainly that's why quite a few of us come here. and others convert. and some slip away... the frenzy is building. consider the sjw that have been getting more aggressive at even the smallest of events. win or lose, they're likely to take to the streets and set it ablaze. they're just looking for a reason... aren't you? we live with government like we jaywalk. or cut other corners. our sense of it is just heightened now. so it feels more real than it is... that real effect on our lives. martyr of the day, forgotten tomorrow in the next headline... as easily traded as loyalties in *any* crowd. everyone has an agenda.. most do anyway. he carried far enough. so golf claps for that, shall we? > i deluded and deranged until i decided to deliver a delicate debutante derisively to a dealer who flinged me through a misty, forgotten past of weirdness into a realm of the great orange centipedes who milled about, carrying jars of viruses, spilling the contents on one computer and then another, attempting to sabotage and crash the systems of the world, while others ingratiated themselves with gratuitous postings while ingratiously ingnoring the posters they admire. as this sub crashed, those within rightfully coexist in a single word guillotined by the ops, and the virus vibrated vivaciously through the vital vines of victory. i pondered and plundered and wandered and wondered until i laundered and thundered into an open edit with a "closed" sign... > the washing machine laundered and thundered and bounced me into the edit with a "closed" sign, which it mistook for a "clothes" sign, but that's okay, since the medium was written and washing machines don't understand writing anyways. the washer jostled me and jiggled me and jumbled me and jangled me while i adjusted to the juxtaposition of inanity with insanity. i began to ponder the question of why indeed this edit is "closed" > as i ponder this significant universal question, a user with more vowels in his short name than should be allowed appeared on the scene, attempt to rectify the situation of the edit being "closed." however, before he did his dutiful deed to reopen the edit to more maniacal mischief, he was distracted by a patriot who wore his creed on his sleeve, and they began to argue over the merit of bovine consumption over porcine consumption. the debate was short, all was forgotten, so i remembered all and all was quite happy to have at least one user who remembered all. i hesitated. > and all at once, an anonymous englishman wearing a button with a penny-farthing attached to his turtleneck sweater tumbled into the unreal reality and soon become ensnared in amber bonds of delicious fragrance. he then began to misspell all of his words with radical effervescence and effervescent radicalism, until all the radicals effervescently radiated and effervesced into a chorus decrying the death and hailing the life of pepe. i pondered if i should resurrect john jacob jingleheimerschmidt, and then realized that this edit was no place to have such thoughts. i expired, exploded, exported and explicated until i was sure that all things were beyond mentioning. so i drove to mentioning and then ventured beyond its borders... <eos> he hasn't really turned on trump though. he literally said this on periscope today: ["anybody who votes for hillary clinton is fuckin' dead to me."](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottadamssays/comments/57ohqu/scott_adams_on_periscope_anybody_who_votes_for/?st=iubs3wrh&sh=b381cff7) <eos> isn't that the same thing he said when he was going full persuasion on right to end your life when you have a chonic illness? <eos> sad to say i unfollowed scott adams after yesterday. lost a ton of respect. edit: i won't repeat what he said, just know that i unfollowed him mid-periscope. and it has to do with trump. <eos> why? what happened? <eos> why? <eos> what happened yesterday? <eos> soon as he got a girlfriend he changed <eos> have you seen his girlfriend? worth it. trump would approve. <eos> nah, trump would never respect him for bitching out at the first sign of real trouble, especially after all his talk about the third act. he's been exposed as a cuck, it's over. <eos> no girl is worth it. she will dump him for another guy by end of the year and next year he will have nothing left but hillary presidency. <eos> psa: that girl isn't a result of his persuasive powers, she's likely a result of his money. he presents her as proof of his persuasive powers. she's just a prop. an attractive prop, but still just more smoke and mirrors from the dilbert man. <eos> she's his neighbor, so she must've already had enough money. <eos> so you think she's not really his girlfriend? or you think she's a sugar baby? you could make a case for sugar baby, but she's def with him. they took a trip to switzerland last week. <eos> they're definitely fucking, but she's totally using him for his money and fame. her stated profession is "model and social media personality", and he's a rich famous guy. he could have the personality of a damp rag and still be hitting that. <eos> sugar baby. yeah could be, i'd totally buy that. either way, good for him. she's worth the money. if she is a sugar baby then he definitely isn't changing any views for her. <eos> no girl is worth the money, dude. come on. <eos> the money is the result of his persuasive powers. <eos> scott adams girlfriend, for the curious: https://www.reddit.com/r/scottadamssays/comments/54rfyy/meet_scott_adams_neighbor_and_periscope_cuddle/?st=iubri48m&sh=01317525 <eos> he's dating an instagram model? #hahahahaha <eos> i get it. i also happened to notice as well. <eos> what did he do yesterday? i don't see anything on twitter. <eos> apparently he said on periscope that the new allegations against trump are really going to hurt him in the election and that it's taking all the fun out of blogging about trump for him. and the donald can't handle that, for some reason? i mean, it's obviously true. that doesn't mean we give up. it's just a reason to fight harder. scott also said this on periscope today: ["anybody who votes for hillary clinton is fuckin' dead to me."](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottadamssays/comments/57ohqu/scott_adams_on_periscope_anybody_who_votes_for/?st=iubs3wrh&sh=b381cff7) <eos> nah he said its over for trump. <eos> unless something big happens to change things. you forgot that part of what he said. <eos> thats pretty much fatalistic. <eos> he's been down and saying it's over for trump since friday what's weird is last friday he was more on the upside and he knew stuff like this was coming (and said it) now he's really down and thinking trump is finished <eos> there's no way it's over for him, i believe the silent majority supports him and that he will crush this election. they're using polls and the bought and paid for media as a way to dishearten trump supporters but remember that reagan was down by like 15% when he beat carter in 1980. <eos> i don't see the allegations hurting trump. they're bs and all came out at once which is fake. not sure what scott means in that regard. <eos> look at it from a persuasion viewpoint, not a fact viewpoint. people hear them. they hear they are true. most will never hear the debunking which says they are not true. so they might as well be true. once made, they can not be un-made in the minds of the sheeple voters. <eos> while i agree that the rumors of sexual assault have hurt him a bit i think there's a huge difference in most people's minds between it being bs allegations and there being actual evidence of a real assault. i'm starting to see more and more people wake up to this bs and hopefully theres a clinton bombshell coming in the future that the american people can't ignore. oh and fox actually seemed to be covering the debunking of the leads assault so who knows, maybe people will cover the emails more but i doubt it. <eos> i've seen the opposite, anecdotally. almost everyone i know who i thought was on the verge of voting for trump, has now flipped and vowed never to vote for him. the already existing trump supporters are completely unaffected, but those who were on the fence and leaning his way have now all either jumped to hillary or vowed not to vote. i hope that isn't representative of the general population, but it's hard not to worry. <eos> what do you think of this, op? https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787301455002800128 <eos> i think that it's true for some of the us audience. it's just a question of how many? i don't know that it's enough. also just because people are interested in wikileaks doesn't mean that is more important to them than trump being a rapist (he isn't, but that's what they're all basically being told and many are believing) scott would say from a persuasion point of view the sexual assault allegations are more effective than the wikileaks ones because they are simple. the wikileaks stuff is complicated. combine that with the fact that the media isn't really covering it, and it's kind of a persuasion loser, even though from a logic point of view it's clearly waaaay more important. <eos> i'm worried as well, i truly believe the fate of the country hangs in the balance. i'm not giving up hope though, he's going to win november 8th. also if you don't mind me asking what neck of the woods are you from? i'm from a blue midwestern state and i haven't seen this much support for a republican candidate in my life. <eos> then i pray o'keefe drops the nukes on monday and tuesday. <eos> is she in fifa's/ioc pocket? <eos> do they test for stool softeners and corn removal medication? <eos> should be a post debate drug test. if you do the test first she can just take the drugs after the test... <eos> based dilbert merchant is back! <eos> the clintons paid him off to halt momentum into a swiss bank account. that's why he was in switzerland. <eos> the reason she is 'resting' is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcwzyjbgwje&feature=youtu.be&t=101 <eos> yes, be careful....she may use it as an excuse, any excuse, to back out, because lord knows she does not want to face the music (wikileaks emails) this debate. and, she may also demand trump release his taxes, creating a stalemate. <eos> scott adams just used the election to gain a little, advertise his book, and make a little money. he will stay neutral publicly. he is spineless and uses deception to manipulate the public for his own gain. <eos> to be fair, very easy to pass a drug test if you're even halfway intelligent. not to mention, people in labs can be bought - we don't make shit. <eos> 3rd debate? i'll be amazed if it even happens maga! <eos> i hate this shill <eos> chernobyl was about 6 fuckups all mixed together. there's absolutely no reason for anything close to that to ever happen again. nuclear scare is just a leftover relic from the cold war... it's the best source of energy we have right now. clean, effective, safe. <eos> [the ass was fat.](http://imgur.com/zmp12il) <eos> she's still actively running for president though... <eos> she's still running for president. kinda hard to endorse an opponent in a still-running race. <eos> are you on desktop or mobile? <eos> it comes from hip-hop artist lil b. it means something is great and awesome. <eos> trump should hold a debate with her where they just bash the fuck out of hillary. <eos> she probably realizes the only person who can stop killary's war mongering is trump. maybe trump offers her a job? <eos> whenever don smiles, i smile too. :) <eos> he might be the most beautiful person i've ever seen. i'm being serious. that strong, confident glare in his eyes and that smile of his. don't forget that bragadociousness about his 98 percent success rate in business. he really is the perfect person. i'm straight by the way. he is just that lovable. <eos> yikes <eos> nah just love for the savior of western civilization. <eos> this is how i feel about women who support trump <eos> what a beautiful man. <eos> #maga lets do this!! <eos> c'mon folks! <eos> #don't get complacent lads. we've still got a lot of work to do. #every vote counts. <eos> [america - the whole world is counting on you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j65hieqolro) <eos> cnn: trump supporters see the truth and liken him to a

journalism is dead. propaganda is alive. <eos> my name is joseph goebbels, and i approve this message. <eos> ahh yes about that <eos> at least they were blunt about it. the deception is terrible. <eos> so you made it to argentina after all. /s <eos> when it all comes out that the media is owned by hillary and she goes to jail for treason it will be a glorious day. <eos> they wouldn't even publish the story though. <eos> nope. cnn - hillary visits a women's prison. <eos> visits a women's prison, stays overnight. ftfy <eos> to experience the suffering and gain empathy. <eos> well, donald, sounds like you need a campaign team with cozy, unethical relationships with journalists so you can personally edit the puff pieces those journalists write. oh wait, you're not gonna do that because you have actual integrity! <eos> but, but... nyt said otherwise! *ctr shills head's explode* <eos> that's what journalists do,right! make shit up? <eos> "telling stories"™ <eos> #maga <eos> **we have the best memes, don't we people? the most beautiful memes!** <eos> it's scary to see how much control shillary has. if she wins i can't imagine how much more propaganda will be pumped out. she clearly idolizes stalin. <eos> and gobbles. <eos> earlier today i checked to see if they were covering the podesta leaks. they had two podesta leak articles. one is an entire article blaming russians (of course). the other was selected softball leaks that were clearly carefully selected by the "friends of hillary" writer and hillary's campaign. <eos> it's not the russians anymore. it's trump himself working with wikileaks. <eos> oh. that changed quickly. i am sure they have plenty of evidence to support this, like they did for the russian theory. (they don't in either case). <eos> quite quickly. also verifies the leaks. <eos> that's bush league folks. very small. <eos> rekt <eos> this is what i love about trump. he's playing 4d chess. <eos> all this shit would stop tomorrow if he'd just file suit against the women, nyt, and cnn. <eos> cnn: rare footage of donald trump groping rosa parks at awards ceremony. <eos> cnn: rare footage of donald trump groping rosa parks at awards ceremony. <eos> black communities are reduced by ten percent right now? how do you mean? -.- <eos> u/11110000q u/burgerlaowai [posted!](https://www.reddit.com/r/oldschoolcool/comments/57pel7/rosa_parks_and_muhammed_ali_receiving_medal_for/) <eos> i think it was more than once. <eos> such a racist. /s <eos> but but but but drumpf is a racist!! reeeeeeeeeeeeee <eos> [trump receives elise island medal with mohammad ali, rosa parks and others](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e860cac4e7d6ae2ee923b74a82dc530d77f2953d/0_118_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=1920&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=a01321bb49bb907d35ffd006755f7bf1) ellis island medal of honor pays homage to the immigrant experience and the contribution made to america by immigrants and their children. you can't make this shit up folks, clearly he hates all browns and immegrants!! lol fucking joke media <eos> link to this post? <eos> i think it was this one... i loved this post. i'm using picshd... it glitched up on me again since, i'm less convinced that what i saw was ctr related... your thoughts? https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/57knnz/say_the_line_shill/.compact <eos> dude that's a shitpost. they wouldn't go hard after a shitpost. my guess is it was a glitch. <eos> that's exactly my strategy. i encourage all of them to save everything they can and expose it, either now or at a later time. <eos> quick tl;dr superpacs are not limited in campaign contibutions in exchange for being unaffiliated with the candidate (for obvious conflict of interest problems) ctr is a superpac that became somewhat of an opponent intel gatherer ctr extensively coordinated with a group that is affiliated with clinton, so much that the leadership is also entangled with her campaign ctr acted as an illegal intel gathering service for hillary clinton. illegally. which should be a big deal, but apparently isn't <eos> i knew hillary reminded me of someone i just couldn't quite put my finger on it. <eos> i'm surprised she hasn't found a way or excuse to delete those comments. i guess it's kind of hard to censor the whole of american population. <eos> my mom is praying to god for trump to win the election. she has described hillary as "evil". <eos> it's time to get #mymomhateshillary trending <eos> my mother hates her and can't even say why, but that is where i come in. <eos> womanly instinct. they know a bitch when they see one. my wife watched the debates with me knowing very little about politics, and quickly remarked "she sounds so fake." <eos> you posted that like it would make us not like kanye west. <eos> we must demand her apperance before the debate. make her prove to the american people that she is fit for office, anything less is unacceptable. donald is in mutiple states every day where is hrc? <eos> i dug deep before i ran into comments that are likely fake profiles... but they're pretty convincing... which isn't good either... who would be doing that? <eos> people protecting their identity from ctr, i don't think anyone wants to be doxed and be the next victim of charachter assination by the dnc/msm. <eos> i love this crazy woman. <eos> omg. ctr is heavily brigading her twitter feed. <eos> when the ultra left candidate feels compelled to oppose clinton over trump, you know something is seriously wrong in this election! get her jill! our politics are different but we live and respect you. <eos> yup. i can definitely respect someone who has integrity even if i disagree with their views. <eos> it's like us trump supporters can be adults about a situation and get over identity politics. what an absurd thought, right? <eos> dr. stein is brutally honest. she doesn't like trump but she's willing to be fair to him. i don't agree with most of her positions, but she's consistent and ethical. <eos> the same way our media should be. they don't have to like him, but they can give fair coverage. <eos> bernie with a backbone <eos> well that explains why the cucks don't like her <eos> b a s e d p l a n t l a d y <eos> #go grannie go! <eos> i think she going to endorse trump a few day before the election. <eos> can you imagine the shitstorm? "i don't agree with donald trump on very many policies, but he's an actual candidate who has a connection with the american people and he's running within the confines of the democratic process. hrc is not, and never intended to. i'm so disgusted with the levels of corruption and collusion behind her campaign that on nov. 8th, i urge you to vote for donald j trump to preserve the american way of life." <eos> i want to sexy hug this woman. <eos> **we know you lurk here stein. please just drop out and endorse mr. trump. based aromatherepy merchant can help take hillary down** <eos> why would you want her to drop out? she takes votes from crooked! <eos> perfect scenario is her endorsing and staying on the ballot <eos> she's voting trump. i'm calling it now <eos> https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7860 link for anyone interested. here are some excerpts * 7 obama (owe-bahm-uh)‘s father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the world’s most populous islamic country. * 8 obama (owe-bahm-uh) is ranked as one of the ten most liberal members of the senate because of his support of issues like gay adoption. <eos> #**based crazy tree woman** <eos> ill jill <eos> she's a nut, but we seem to share an enemy in clinton. maga <eos> god damn. she is absolutely killing it for us! go steinipede! <eos> based plant lady's tweets are always read in her voice by my brain and i don't know why, but it makes me happy. <eos> i like jill <eos> she's a pig (hillary) <eos> she's a gilf <eos> amazing. <eos> so glad her voice reaches far on this issue! <eos> i wonder if she might have been a better vp. i like pence but he's such a neocon. <eos> after pence's wavering, trump is going to give him an office 4 stories below the map room, where the mushrooms grow. <eos> what did pence waver on? i must have missed something. <eos> they disagree on alot; trump supports coal mining and natural gas/oil industries, while stein does not, for example <eos> he should make her head of the epa and then de-fund it. <eos> love this, i've been saying ron paul for head of fed and rand paul for secretary of war. put people in charge that don't want to use the "gun in the room" <eos> interesting hmmm <eos> i would have been fine with it but the never trump cuckservatives would freak out <eos> i think pence is a good man with strong beliefs. neocons like neolibs are evil and destructive. <eos> i like that our politics diverge yet i still respect his values. that's the real america to me. <eos> pence is a good guy, but i agree. i'm guessing that was a concession to the gope to gain their support, which didn't work anyway because they're traitorous pieces of shit. <eos> **we have the best based granola doctors, don't we, folks?** <eos> i just hope russia, if they're going to take any action (if obama and the fuck nuts start something), they wait till after the election to see who gets elected. putin has to know that trump wants the us and russia to be allies, not enemies. <eos> if obama does call a war before trump is inaugurated you can be damn sure that when he's sworn in we're gonna see a cease fire in the first week. putin would want that war over with just as much as trump, *nobody* wins in that kind of a war. <eos> **its our job to let the elected servants of the people know war is not acceptable. let your congressmen know they will be jobless if they approve of another baseless war.** <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yddpt21qgyc <eos> trump truly is the good guy in all the scenarios we look at in today's politics. <eos> do you think, knowing that, obama will go to war with russia, prior to, the presidential election? sooo many commas! <eos> good question, captain kirk. <eos> the commas around "prior to" are unnecessary. <eos> they are also superfluous. <eos> superfluously extraneous. <eos> you're correct. see, in the russian political scene, a lot of people want donald trump to be elected, as they know he'll restore sanity on the foreign policy front. there are two major fronts in russian politics. you have the "atlanticists", which are the pro-western people along the lines of the globalists in the us and europe. then, you have the "eurasian sovereigntists", which are people like putin who want all countries to be sovereign, and have one vote, one voice at the world table, instead of one or two countries yelling over, and dominating evryone else. &nbsp; you have to understand something. in russia, being called a "liberal" isn't the kind of insult you'd think it was in the u.s. ***it's a slur, just above calling someone a nazi***. the liberals (which is what the atlanticists are), were responsible for incredible suffering in the 1990s when russia was on her knees. these people stole massive amounts of wealth from the people of russia, and became oligarchs. many, many people died during this time, and many more were plunged into desperate poverty. the liberals basically debased themselves in front of washington and the west for money. and for that reason, along with plundering russia, they are ***universally despised in russia***. the liberals (like mikhail khodorkovsky), get money from western soros-backed ngos. putin ***saved russia***, hence why he is so popular. <eos> they fucking hate gorbachev too, whereas our media is constantly shilling him to us as some genius liberal reformer. russians view him as an incompetent self-promoter who tore apart their empire, reduced them to a 2nd-rate power, and ushered in the economic & political chaos of the '90s. <eos> indeed, but even gorbachev isn't as hated as yeltsin. so long as he had his drink, and knew where his next was coming from, he didn't give a ***shit*** what happened. how do we know patriotic fbi employees are leaking these things, anyway? <eos> well- if we're dumb enough to exercise first strike authority, russians still have deadhand. no one would survive; wealthy elites can only survive for so long in a bunker, and they'd emerge without slaves 4 decades later <eos> yup, he doesn't want his country at war... he wants to run it as the leader and keep illegals out and kill terrorists. he wants to keep power, and war will risk losing that power... though he won't run from it. <eos> he knows as well as we know that there is only one way war is fought in this grim dark future: **full retard** which is bad for everyone. <eos> even if putin is totally evil, he still isn't stupid. there's one thing he really wants: the russian naval port in syria protected. he knows he can hold that militarily, and he's not going to let the us stop him from keeping it. the negotiation would be pretty simple if i were in power. syria isn't in our interest, and it's in his. i would basically tell him this and say that i still need to look like i came away with something. so he gets to eliminate isis for us and keep iran in line. winners all around. i have no idea what obama thinks he's doing. <eos> its fucked up. us fucking around in syria would be like russia fucking around in quebec if there were a canadian revolution. <eos> i think the answer is that we're trying to deny russia the naval port. <eos> oh, great idea, obama. that's like the russians trying to put missiles in cuba. sure to end well. <eos> or the us putting missiles in turkey.. . maybe they justify it as being in response to russia gaining a naval base in the crimea. who knows. <eos> i can put myself in their shoes. seriously i'd be like fuck that, those fucks put missiles in turkey right next to our shit. we need a naval base. <eos> obama is trying to create war... or help some of his islamic friends. <eos> "the sweetest sound i know is the muslim call to prayer" - obama <eos> drone strike incoming barry. pray to your god <eos> when he questioned my muslim faith.... reporter; you mean your christian faith? obuma; ya, my christian faith. <eos> putin may be evil in his own sense and is in no way an admirable person (re: killing journalists), but at least he puts his country and its citizens first <eos> those journalist are probably cia... <eos> agreed putin does put his country and people first. and it's according to our lying media that he killed anyone. the same u.s. media making up false allegations against trump and julian. i would take everything the media says with a grain of salt. also at this point our media has committed treason and wouldn't blame anyone if they disappeared... <eos> that's a good point. why the heck should i believe anything the msm says. they are setting up putin as a boogeyman. maybe he killed the journalist, maybe he didn't, but i can't take the word of our gov and it's propaganda machine <eos> why did he kill a journalist? <eos> mr putin could take out some of the shill scum at nyt and cnn and the world would be a better place <eos> exactly... though you may argue his citizens aren't in the best situations, he isn't shy of doing what his country needs. <eos> putin= dr. doom. hitlary= the joker <eos> obligatory mf doom namedrop. adult swim turned me on to him. i love adult swim. <eos> i like turtles <eos> dont flatter hillary! she's more like mystique, so flip floppity she even changes her appearance time to time. <eos> lol. <eos> doom is always right...a straight up god slayer. i want to be on his side. <eos> at least doom keeps his word. <eos> thats the biggest insulting to the joker i've ever heard, the joker is a cunning psychopath who is usually steps ahead of everyone. hillary is a rotting pile of chit who would be in prison / hanged if she wasn't backed by the real threat. <eos> oh heck yeah! joker's way better than hitlary in the iq department. i just make the comparison because she's insane and really just wants to watch the world burn. <eos> do trump next. <eos> yoda + doctor who + george washington + 40k emperor = trump <eos> donald trump = tony stark (who ran for president instead of building a suit) <eos> i dunno, stark seemed like a bit of a globalist shill in civil war. <eos> alright stark-stalin = trump remember in iron man 2 in front of congress total trump <eos> batman+captain america+ teddy roosevelt= trump <eos> trumps not wearing hockey pads. <eos> forgot god-emperor <eos> oops! kek forgive me. <eos> i'm 99% sure mike pence is our dimension's race bannon. just wanted to add that. <eos> good call 'pede. <eos> and yet, our god is a god of chaos (praise kek)... you've got to admit, there is something jokery about all of this. <eos> toss in some deadpool then <eos> justice and irony often go hand in hand with one another. <eos> i love this adorable pepe a little more every time it's posted. he looks like a muppet baby. <eos> [you might want this then.](https://sli.mg/prfork) <eos> yes <eos> > a muppet pepe. <eos> source please to share? <eos> i think it was [this being referred to](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37316615). not sure which hack they are talking about here though. <eos> seems hacking 101 isn't brutr force, blowjobs and coding. it's pretending to be someone else <eos> social engineering is legitimate hacking technique <eos> social engineering seems like a bullshit way of saying being a con man. <eos> its a fancier way :) but a lot of hacking is done that way. gaining access to the physical hardware is easiest, or learning about someone so you can figure out their favorite animal, birthday, street they grew up on, etc.. to figure out their password <eos> if you want to look into it these attacks are called 'social engineering' attacks. very interesting. spear phishing would be an attack that uses social engineering and technical exploits, for example. <eos> i listen to a [prank call podcast](http://www.phonelosers.org) where the guy running it is a genius at social engineering. he calls up all sorts of businesses, pretending to be from 'the corporate office,' and convinces the people on the other end of the line to hand over reams of customer phone numbers which he then uses in prank calls. he did a segment for a radio station once where he called up a verizon help-line and convinced a whole bunch of verizon employees to hand over their v-code; essentially that's your verizon id, and using that he could easily call up verizon offices and gain access to customer account info... including their passwords. really opened my eyes to how insecure information is. <eos> one reason i love the show mr. robot. it's so legit in terms of the technical expertise and the various ways they showcase how hacks, including social engineering, take place. <eos> "i'm joe hackerman the county password inspector. i need to ask for your social security number, date of birth, and mother's maiden name." <eos> shitpost likely. <eos> guys, my user name...think about it. we have never used offensive cyber, why? b/c it would result in mad. this russia blaming has to stop. <eos> we use cyber warfare all the time. every developed country is constantly spying on everyone else. <eos> what is mad? <eos> moronic arsehole democrats <eos> mothers against deplorables <eos> mutually assured destruction <eos> actually, it's looking like it was a couple of bored brit kids and a couple of virginians. <eos> listen m8 i do t make the memes. i just shit them up and post them. <eos> cutest fucking pepe deploradorable <eos> #white hats <eos> tha's a cute pepe op! <eos> fbianon right?

#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ws8b1qp5kq <eos> [removed] <eos> how? he was a failure. i voted for him in '08 and he was a miserable failure by 2010. he didn't do a damn thing...and from 2009-2011 he had both chambers of congress plus a filibuster-proof majority in the senate, yet he did absolutely nothing!!! all he did was do obamacare which fucked us over and gave more money to insurance companies and bail out wall street and the car companies...how the hell can you spin his first term as a success? <eos> i mean we can agree to disagree but you have to remember, there is a percentage of centipedes that associated with democrats before coming over to the maga side, i am one of them. and not being tolerant of their past decisions in voting is not a way to keep your voters. we're a basket of many different types of people from different backgrounds. we're supposed to be the intolerant ones, let's set an example for the libtards by not being intolerant not all of us trump supporters are 100% on board with his policies either. there are some i find ridiculous, but at the end of the day, i'd rather have trump than killary <eos> oh yeah i'm a former bleeding heart liberal. but when obama said 'if i had a son he'd look like trayvon martin (that thug!)' that flipped a switch in me and i was like 'this isn't what liberalism is supposed to be'. and i gradually changed into a conservative and the rest is history. obama fooled me in 2008. and you actually pardon him for fucking up libya/syria/iraq [which all happened in his first term]??? (okay, i give you iraq. he did not start the war at all, but the whole isis thing was due to him not doing much to support the iraqi govt or combat them and instantly pull out all soldiers, creating a vacuum. hell he helped start isis with secret arms deals and propping up so-called 'moderate' rebels who were actually isis all along!). and i'm glad you like trump overall...but if you're gonna peddle that 'obama was okay in his first term...' bullshit on here i'll call you out and point out his failures during his first term every time. <eos> all of us are in different situations, and all of us have different opinions. fighting people on the same side as you doesn't make us look good as a community. <eos> i mean we can go back and forth on that all day. hillary played a big role in that too, as well as congress. bush had his fair share of mistakes too. and in his first term when the obamacare discussion was starting around 2010, i was 100% on board with it. then they started making adjustments, and more adjustments, and mitch mcfuckingconnel helped make it even worse. now obamacare is a disaster. and while the things he did wrong during that time were very wrong, they didn't affect me. i don't mind obama, and when he was given this country he was given a shit show. and while this can't directly be attributed to obama, our economy is in better shape than it was 8 years ago. <eos> okay my bad for the way i come across. and yeah dumbya was a fucking disaster (dare i say worse than obama...but that's not saying much). i'm not defending that disaster, bush. anyways glad you're on board the trump train and let's beat the fuck out of shillary 'the demon'!!! <eos> fucking cringe fest right there. good one. <eos> his writters you mean, when he's not reading from a teleprompter and actually has to think he is a stuttering mess. <eos> he used to be pretty good on his own i'll give him that much, now, not so much. <eos> the guy can't even finish a sentence without an "uh" imagine how many times obama has muttered "uh" during his presidency. <eos> well, that's still something of a talent. even with an entire team trying to prop her up, the best hiliary can do (in her own staffs words) is 'not come off like a bitch.' <eos> if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if if you say so <eos> okie doke. <eos> i love you people. i can't quit you! <eos> evan? <eos> with hammers <eos> jellycals <eos> buy pepe <eos> like golf? <eos> he's busy trying to start a war with iran through yemen. we've sent tomahawks at iranian back rebels. after obama paid iran $1.4 billion dollars, without getting congressional approval which is required for that high of an amount. so we're fighting iran after we've given them a shit load of cash. he's also planning on using the cia to conduct cyber attacks on russia, whose sole purpose is to embarrass putin. there is no benefit in embarrassing a foreign political leader. this is some recess level shit coming from the potus. <eos> that's consistent with his personality domestically - recess level shit. <eos> i don't know why this isn't pointed out more, it goes way beyond endorsement, it's like he's running again!! <eos> yeah seriously. i can remember if there has been a time in the past when the sitting president's wife campaigned against one of the candidates. like how michelle obama did her speech trying to stump donald trump. <eos> he's putting in the same amount of energy as if he were in a re-election campaign. i think it's embarrassing for our country and completely unfair to our political system. to have our sitting president fly around in air force one doing tons of events for a presidential candidate...disgraceful. <eos> bill clinton, dubya, and reagan didn't pull this shit and campaign instead of the next same-party nominee...this is fucking insane and unprecedented <eos> that's what i've been saying. there should be a law against it. we didn't elect this bastard to play golf, go on tv shows all of the time, insult the other party's nominee, and campaign for his successor. <eos> bathhouse barry is campaigning like he's running for a third term like fdr. while crooked sleeps and gets her drug syringes ready. <eos> if he's on the golf course it means he's not using his pen and phone to screw the country. <eos> he still has a cell phone. he can order his cartel do commit his treason. here's him on his on cell phone: https://youtu.be/dgjib5co0cq <eos> trump is mentioning it during his rallies <eos> he's running for dear life. in his mind, if trump wins, the depth of the corruption comes out, and no one will be around to pardon his sorry globalist ass. <eos> i disagree, i think trump would easily be willing to make a deal to pardon obama as long as obama cooperates by ratting out the bank cartels, clinton, and the dirty money <eos> bingo <eos> i only have one up vote for you. <eos> check with the left and they can help you "create" more upvotes. <eos> exactly. they both can pardon each other, whichever way the wind ends up blowing. <eos> this is honestly one of the best mails. <eos> bigleaguetruth <eos> hey! its spelled bigly!! <eos> big lee! <eos> bigly <eos> #bigly <eos> #bigly <eos> woah, secret service going to be tested... book it! <eos> trump steps into the oval office obama chuckles, trump fell right into his trap "get him." obama says to the two secret service agents by his side. they stand still, not acknowledging the president's command. "i said get him!" sweat builds up on the brow of the increasingly distressed commander. "i can't let you do that, star fox." trump says as the agents turn inwards to obama the president's visage of anger turns to sudden fear. he knows. "obama. you're fired!" exclaims trump as the agents take our fallen leader into custody for crimes against the nation. america breaks into song at once, an eagle flies into the office window and lands on our new president's shoulder letting out a cry of glory and freedom. <eos> brings a tear to my eye. <eos> that'd bring a tear to ol' ronnie reagan's eye <eos> not quite u/donhisattva's story, but good nonetheless https://youtu.be/di8ktnji9aw <eos> he needs to tweet out more of these sketchy emails. there are so many damning ones that i see here, and obviously on no major news outlets. then they get buried and not seen by anyone but the_donald users, who already know she's corrupt as f. <eos> we must get the compiled lists of crap from the emails to the trump campaign. the witch is going down! (but not on bubba) <eos> we need a compiled list of the most damaging emails including images / infographics that we can share on social media. it's the only way to redpill the rest--with short details and images linking to sources. <eos> so wat you waiting for? start compiling! <eos> a list of all the most damming ones. compile a list that exposes everything with the emails and the explanations. she needs to go down.. big league <eos> http://www.vaskal.ca/podestafiles (; <eos> **ask nixon if coverups are what executive privilege is for** <eos> ask him about war on drugs. piece of shit president. <eos> nixon's original war in drugs actually called for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for users as well as punishing dealers. over the years politicians stopped giving a fuck about rehab. <eos> can't you say the same shit about obama care? <eos> what? no. how? <eos> your justifying the war on drugs i can justify obama care and say it was better before it went through a majority republican congress. <eos> no. nixon's war on drugs actually had solutions to the problems. he was enacting preventative measures against drug use and rehabilitation for drug users so there wasn't demand. literally the way most people think would be the way to successfully win the war on drugs. stop the demand. obama's plan had always been to subsidize and socialize health insurance. he did exactly that. <eos> obama has conned the left lock stock and barrel. they are such fools. <eos> oh hey where have we seen obama trying to abuse this privilege before?

<eos> yes. it's why he was sending emails under his pseudonym. he's in it up to his neck and if they prosecuted hillary all the breadcrumbs would have led to his computer and they'd have to prosecute him for security violations also. a nd what they have done is against 18 usc section 793 and they'd go to prison for it. for a long time because each incident gets you 10 years at leavenworth, and she has hundreds... <eos> you mention fort leavenworth, does this code apply to civilians as well? genuinely unsure. <eos> i want to know how obama let all this go on without his hand in the clinton foundation cookie jar, does not pass the smell test. obama has to have a piece of the action, maybe in the "panama papers" or something similar. <eos> he's got to be getting paid under the table from somewhere. he's retiring to a 5.3million house that rents for $22,000 a month. not bad for a lifelong government employee. <eos> hey he sold two books someone else wrote for him. don't be judgy! <eos> interesting how that works. <eos> hmmmm... he's gonna catch shit about it being legal tho... with no one questioning why they were sent to a private email server at all... <eos> #wew <eos> lads <eos> you can't spell potus without pos. <eos> potus knows that his legacy will be undone if trump wins. it would be a repudiation of the last 8 years. and this is not considering the investigations into his administration's cover-ups that would kick off on day one or two. <eos> #this is a facebook post and not a tweet <eos> trump probably shouldn't pursue this aspect. potus has executive privilege and can be exempt from foia requests and even subpeonas. withholding president's emails isn't an unreasonable precaution imo. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_privilege <eos> i think more important than any "what ifs"... is the fact that obama lied about his knowledge of the email server and this and other leaks proves it. <eos> not just trying to be argumentative here...but i don't see how this proves obama knew about clinton's server. unless he knew he was emailing to her private server? but if he was just emailing to the contact saved in his outlook or something he may have only seen her name and not the actual address he was emailing to. i doubt obama manages his own outlook contact list... unless he was also using a third party email to communicate with hillary on her server? fbi said he used a 'pseudonym'...not sure if that was just his official email saved under a different name in the outlook server or if he used a separate email entirely? <eos> obama was aware of the server because they were not using a .gov account <eos> did obama not use a .gov account? my point is he may not have known he was emailing to a non .gov account. if you save someone in your contact list or on the outlook server contact list by name, you may not even see their actual email address when you email them. you type in 'hillary clinton' and it emails her. and if he doesn't manage his own contact list(probably doesn't) then he may have had no idea that he was emailing a non gov account. <eos> there was another leak that showed that obama was actually using a pseudonym (made up name acc) gmail.com that he was using to email back and forth within the server. <eos> can you link that one? didn't know it was a gmail acc... <eos> perhaps, but it does cause people to be skeptical of it all especially when there has been no notification of obama using executive privilege in this case. on top of that, it may cause some to question the usage of executive privilege in such situations where the president may have committed a crime. <eos> agreed, but at the end of the day it seems like it was a reasonable precaution to take when responding to the subpeona. who knows, maybe they could have been liable under some law if they wrongfully released the president's emails. i don't think they're wrong for taking a careful look at this... <eos> holy poop on a stick. <eos> anybody that is running for president should have their pasts exposed first. obama had barely to zero past so getting elected no one knows what he will do but was voted primarily because he was the first american black person to be nominated for the white house and that we did not want anymore racial tensions hoping this was going to end it. i am not really surprised since it matches a lot of laws that he subverted and broken during his eight years of presidency so if hillary wins none of that would be on him, but if trump wins all of that will haunt him and severely limiting his options. <eos> potus probably gets a "speaking fee" from the clinton foundation to campaign for clinton. <eos> this is to good. <eos> any reason to not allow an e-mail to be seen is fine by this bunch. nobody will know anyways, they'll all be wiped. <eos> obama has secrets with the muslim brotherhood that would get him impeached <eos> #if if if if if if if if if if if if okie dokie nothing to see her folks! <eos> http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18usc00793.html i call your attention to 18 u.s.c. section 793 (d-g) specifically. note the word "intent" is mentioned nowhere herein. <eos> he's dragging him nowhere, he only points out that potus might already be up to his neck in the mud. also, anything that hurts obama helps us. i remember the recent poll analysis that 90% of those who have a favorable view of obama choose clinton, while 90% of those who think he's a failure choose trump. not really surprising, but anything exposing obama and bringing him down might also drag shillary down with him. <eos> get that fucker dirty! lock him up!!! <eos> treason. tavi. <eos> **obama drug cartel.** <eos> clinton and obama only emailed 8 times during her tenure. looks like it worked. <eos> anne holton? so our pence on the inside is still undetected? all is going as planned. <eos> what a madman!!! i can't wait for next week!!! final debate is on wed <eos> its not a real tweet someone give me the linko <eos> holy fuck it's a facebook post <eos> link to facebook post https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157897465130725&substory_index=0&id=153080620724 <eos> lmao <eos> this isn't showing up on my myspace anywhere? <eos> can't find this one on netflix. <eos> can you download it from napster? <eos> download it from my bearshare! its there!!!! <eos> she is dying <eos> the dream come true. <eos> i'm dying 😂 <eos> hijacking the top comment with a theory. what if hillary knows something insanely illegal was in joe podesta's email account and is literally on the run in the event it's exposed in a future dump and has the fbi or someone after her. <eos> i know this isn't the case but i want to believe. hillary shacked up in some donkey stable down in a hillside dump in ecuador... <eos> what a great concept for a ben garrison comic <eos> i don't know how any presidential candidate can be allowed to run and "win" like this. clinton supporters are truly stupid if they vote for someone that can't even campaign for themselves in the last month of the election. <eos> they have absolutely no idea she isn't campaigning. this isn't news you will see on cnn or msnbc. all they see is the line of women claiming to be molested by trump. <eos> true, my mother said all the stuff i shared with her + wikileaks was never on the news stations she normally watches. she checks in with me daily for new info. <eos> so basically every redditor outside this sub? absolutely. their only validation is criticising our perspectives and views, downvoting and bashing anything right-wing, and they all honestly think it makes them correct. sad! <eos> last month? when has she campaigned? <eos> the people i have spoke to that are voting for her - they seem to know how bad she is - they don't care. i don't understand it - and i know i'm not alone - this is destroying relationships, marriages, friendships, etc. <eos> that's saddening. i'm lucky i was able to convince my mom about everything going on. she was a lifelong democrat. my sister on the other hand she gets super pissed about trump...refuses to talk about it and just says all politicians are dirty but she can't stand sexual assault...i'm like really? did you look into the claims before asserting that? <eos> i've had countless people tell me it's obvious who there voting for because they're gay, they're mexican, they're a woman, etc. as if they don't even have options because of their identity. <eos> if i was in usa i'd tell people what i have a few times which gets them super triggered, that if hillary wins, not only will your taxes go up, but your taxes help fund the saudi military which supports isis to take over their neighbors and just repeat that fact. everything else is irrelevant. 'how much tax per year would you have to pay that ends up going to support isis before you think it is a problem? like, give me a number. $100, $200?' <eos> >she is dying this fucking crusty cunt better don't die before she's gets thrown in jail. <eos> once she's sentenced, she will play up the sick card bigly. <eos> obama will probably have her charged, convicted, and pardoned so the incoming president can give her zero jail time. what she is avoiding is being asked questions and having any public appearances at all turn into a pr nightmare. because there are a lot of questions people on the trump train would throw at her, that would derail her entire appearance. for this reason, having a representative appear dissipates her responsibility to properly campaign by hiding. <eos> she has committed so many crimes, there's not enough time for obama to pardon her for everything. she'll see the inside of a jail cell for sure. <eos> does a pardon cover things that weren't charged? i imagine a diligent prosecutor could pretty much always dig up new dirt from these thousands of leaked emails. <eos> ford pardon nixon for crimes "he may have committed" so hillary will no doubt get a similarly worded pardon. <eos> no president can pardon any impeachable offense. it's not a blanket authority. <eos> those are rules for a president not an emperor <eos> thanks for the info, but man is that horseshit. rules for thee, not for me. <eos> > obama will probably have her charged, convicted, and pardoned so the incoming president can give her zero jail time. which is ridiculous. after what bill did on his last day congress should have fought for a constitutional amendment that bans the president from pardoning high level donors and people in his or her cabinet, at the very least. <eos> obama pardoning clinton would probably be the first constitutional thing he's actually done. <eos> obama is guilty of treason too. he's going down too. <eos> i sure do hope so ~ this is turning out to be a great year. <eos> not before she gets out of prison <eos> you assume her sentence would be based on years. <eos> decades <eos> millenia. <eos> if she's committed treason, she'll get 3 years in prison. or the shorter sentence of life. *ba dum cha* <eos> minimum is 5. <eos> she's not gonna make it 6 months. <eos> an upvote a day keeps the globalist at bay. <eos> she is detoxing, because she is building tolerance to her anti seizure medication and needs to be ready for the debate. she is also the only candidate that goes down in the polls the more she appears, hence why they have an army of people stumping for her...obama, michelle, gore, kaine, biden, the rapist. god forbid she win. who is going to run the country for the disappearing president? <eos> bimbo dickens, who else <eos> for the life of me i do not understand why republicans will not campaign with trump. while the democrats are corrupt as hell, at least they all stick with their candidate to the end no matter how bad they are. <eos> they don't need to. whether it's because they don't want to or trump didn't ask them. trump goes to 3 rallies a day. when he holds a rally, it's like a concert. people go to see him. <eos> i like to think he is winning enormously with his small entourage and when some came to the rnc complaining about him hurting them in their races he cut everyone lose to run their campaigns with or against him. maybe, maybe not, but i do believe there is a... #landslide incoming <eos> yeah, i really do believe they pump her with so many drugs that they have to let her go into withdrawal mode just to let them work for the major events. this must really be taking a toll on her body. i'd be surprised if she didn't have a heart attack yet. when your body fluctuates so frequently with drugs, you risk more strokes and heart attacks. <eos> transfusions <eos> imagine the toll on people who have to be around her. can you imagine hillary, already a notorious cunt, undergoing withdrawals? would be surprised if anyone on this ss detail hadn't pondered capping her themselves lol. <eos> probably why she had a stroke and hit her head. <eos> errr uh i mean "blood clot". <eos> don't you mean pneumonia? <eos> bwahaha! how is anyone even considering her? ~~pneumoniagate~~ seizuregate seems applicable here too, but i was referencing her hitting her head, having a blood clot, and traumatic brain injury right before the benghaz hearings. <eos> "because trump says mean things!" <eos> and you see that long list of "events"...only **one** is a rally and it's because obama is the speaker. the rest are all fundraisers and voter registration events. super low-energy. pathetic! <eos> what is a voter registration event? is there fundraising and other bullshit going on there? <eos> they're held in cemeteries <eos> no poor people allowed. <eos> at least she is showing up for the 3rd debate, so trump can crush her like he did in the 1st two debates. <eos> trump was low key the first debate, that was obviously a mistake. i expect a lion fighting for his life for the third. <eos> i think he didn't want to come across as being to abrasive, but he learned that we are all standing behind him and we need him to stand up to that witch, because nobody else has the balls to do it. i think he'll kick her ass in this last debate. <eos> i wish they'd agree to at least one more debate. first week of november. wouldn't that be great? <eos> i want another vp debate tbh. <eos> is like to see her do back-to-back debates. i don't think she could make it through. <eos> i'd settle for a three-hour debate. doesn't it go so quickly? they barely get through any questions. it's amazing how they have 22 debates between hillary and obama and a dozen between bernie and hillary, but only three during the general election. i guess it's customary, but i think they should have 6-10 starting after the conventions. <eos> i'm actually watching the 1984 presidential debate between reagan and mondale on c-span right now. the 1988 presidential debate is coming up after this one, in about an hour. reagan said just a few minutes ago, that between us and russia, we can destroy the world or save it. sounds a lot like our situation now. if hillary is president, we will have massive problems in regards to russia. <eos> i wouldn't put it past her to skip out on them if there was a really big bombshell which she didn't want trump to bring to national attention. <eos> i think monday to tuesday is gonna be a shitshow when it comes to hillary scandals <eos> toatally agree. this is going to be the best early christmas ever! <eos> we haven't even seen his final form yet. <eos> did anyone else get a survey asking what they wanted to see from trump in the final debate? th campaign asked if they thought he applied too much or too little force on hillary, if he should articulate more on policy issues, etc. i replied to go full force against clinton because it was one of the only things swaying undecideds towards him. that he didn't need to comment more on the military or gun policies because people in those camps already were voting for him, and to comment on the clinton uranium deal giving 20% of rights to russia if she brings up more russian nonsense herself. <eos> he's going to sacrifice her on stage to kek so we may meme forever. <eos> pure beam of light is his final form. <eos> he just keeps getting better with every speech. so looking forward to the next one!! <eos> he reminds me of a guy named nigel. <eos> thornberry? <eos> smashing! <eos> i hope he verbally strikes her down as a golden nimbus of light encircles his head. he turns towards the cameras, stepping over hillary's shattered and twitching form, looking directly into the cameras and says "join me, unite this fractured land and together we will make this nation great again and assume our place as a starfaring race across the stars!" https://i.sli.mg/hrshpg.png <eos> bless you ~ that was beautiful. <eos> please tell me he shoots freedom from his nipples <eos> i hope he throws her out of an airlock into space, like sigourney weaver did in aliens. <eos> america, no, the world needs trump to target these cultural marxist globalist leaders clinton and obama at his next debate like never before. we are the only resistance for preserving journalist integrity in this country. our coverage of these wikileaks will be known in the history books to be as influential as deep throat was to watergate. we are literally shit-posting our way to the white house, to congressional and senate seats, and into the minds of every journalists. <eos> https://i.sli.mg/95ogu6.jpg <eos> you're missing alex, jr, and eric. <eos> that is the deplorables, this is the vanguard of kek <eos> alex jones, lmao...i love that guy so much...how does he sound so damn intelligent and coherent 90% of the time in his shows and the other 10% he starts screaming and repeating 'hillary and obama are demons because they smell like sulfur and have flies land on them!!!' <eos> he does sounds ridiculous at times, but the man is a patriot and is an remnant of what journalism used to be. an emotional expression of one's thoughts. we simply do not see anyone like alex because they're too concerned with being presentable. sometimes alex just wears a shirt and jeans. feels like a fun person to have a beer with and shoot shit. <eos> that 10% is having fun at work. <eos> she's still in the burn unit after the second debate <eos> imagine only having the stamina for two events a month and needing to pump yourself up with drugs to get through a mere 90 minutes. she's like a rotten husk, corrupted from the inside out. <eos> the visuals you just afforded me are vomit inducing. <eos> # #whereshillary <eos> why the hell is she not doing a single fucking rally in the month of october? meanwhile donald is busting his ass and doing 2-4 rallies per day!!1 <eos> and not a single media person questions this. so bizarre. <eos> after the debates she has to recover in hospice care. <eos> because trump is 70 with the stamina of a 40 year old, but hillary is 68 with the stamina of a 98 year old. <eos> she seems to not be worried about losing, i wonder why? oh yeah she has it rigged <eos> you hit the nail on the head. she doesn't have to worry about a thing. the media and her minions are doing her work for her. she knows the election is rigged, which allows her to sit back and smugly laugh at any and all accusations. when you own the media, the government and the fbi, there isn't really much to cause you concern. <eos> meanwhile trump is flying around the country multiple times a day to attend many events and hold numerous rallies. <eos> **insiders say she is dropping out** <eos> this is awesome. too bad this can't get trendjng <eos> this should be some kind of hashtag. #hillaryquits <eos> ##dropping to the floor <eos> my sources are saying walt mondale will take over the ticket <eos> the most pathetic candidate in presidential history? <eos> makes sense. they all know by now that there is no stumping the trump, so they just send out the guy who was already stumped for the ages by reagan to deliver a 2-in-1 intent to run- and concession-speech. saves anyone with dignity from the humiliation. <eos> yay minnesota <eos> that's not jeb bush <eos> no one wants to see her speak so they get people that might actually fill a venue to speak for her while she gets the guy that made the six million dollar man to work on her <eos> it's actually pretty smart because barack, michelle, etc are all way more popular than she will ever be. <eos> that's a lot of fundraising and one or two rallys. <eos> well, you know she left the white house broke. lol <eos> even hillary supporters have to wonder what this is all about. who ever heard of a presidential candidate who doesn't show up to give speeches at rallies? #whereshillary <eos> and literally no one other than obama and kaine are going to draw a crowd. i've never even heard of half of them <eos> unfit <eos> big league <eos> i like how the president of the united states (who sort of... has a job to do?) is working harder on her campaign than she is. <eos> she is sick. trying to hide so that no one notices. <eos> where is this bitch!!??! show yourself you fucking hag!!! <eos> kinda hard to run for president when you have advanced parkinsons. <eos> must be nice, hillary. must be nice. <eos> the american people will take notice of this. <eos> lol they have podesta as the keynote speaker for 21 october. what a mess that will be. <eos> do you want a shit show? because that is how you get a shit show. <eos> she's hoping all the flies will be dead by then. <eos> #low energy <eos> no energy <eos> negative energy <eos> . #hillaryshiding <eos> best birthday present ever! <eos> jon favreau and moby? jesus christ! and they call trump the "celebrity" candidate. <eos> unless the dnc and establishments have something up their sleeves. talk about overconfidence that may potentially cost them the election this november. stay on the look out centipedes! we know how low these fuckers will go. i won't be surprised when they pull another shit up from their dirty sleeves. <eos> her puppet master soros owns the voting machines in 16 states. why waste the effort on rallies. edit for spelling <eos> 1984 <eos> #she doesn't have the stamina <eos> #madman <eos> hillary is so odious that her mere presence at events and fundraisers intended to help her campaign actually has the opposite effect. <eos> i wonder if alex jones is right and she really does smell? <eos> i think now i'm starting to pity her. she's sick and has to suffer all this withdrawal to even stand for 90 minutes. just drop out hillary. you've done enough <eos> put in bernie the cuck or biden in. i just want trump to btfo someone. it will be cheap looking to see donald with 538 evs to 0 evs to everyone else. at least make it 535-3 (give the dems dc, their eternal consolation prize) <eos> jon favreau? fuck you. <eos> this is puzzling to me. not one event, other than the debate. i've been running through possibilities - they (the campaign) / she are worried that she may have to answer questions re: wikileaks (protesters) - doesn't really float, the media wouldn't show anything negative like that. they / she is worried she might have another medical episode. - this is plausible, if severe enough, it *might* get some coverage. do we even know where she is? is she home in ny? could she be in 'war room' mode, calling in favors, trying to come up with more supposed dirt on trump (already happening although poorly / weak really), etc. is she so grating that just hearing her speak actually hurts her in the polls? again, at least plausible, however at a rally she'd be talking to her supporters, so i discount this. the only thing that seems to make sense to me is she really is feeling unwell, at least unwell enough to not travel and speak at a rally. honestly, and maybe i'm wrong, but i've seen many election cycles, going back to nixon when i was a kid, but i don't ever remember a candidate going dark / off the air for the last month of the campaign. seems unprecedented to me. here's another thought, which i throw out only for the lulz... she's planning her november 9th escape to a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the usa. (just in case) <eos> she's in a reptilian stasis pod while they grow her some new organs. the drugs she took before the debate fried the last ones. <eos> i wonder if her lack of appearances, as she knows she doesn't resonate well with the public, has anything to do with any upcoming attacks against our god emperor. the more she stays out of the public eye, the less of an opportunity we have to hate her. <eos> lol at podesta showing his face anywhere. <eos> ikr? "hey runner4567, /pol/ says hi!" <eos> #where's hillary then again, at this point, what difference does it make? <eos> in massachusetts, we had ted kennedy's old seat go up after he died. the democrat who was destined to have it didn't even bother to campaign for it. a fresh republican hit the streets and campaigned hard. scott brown 'stole' it. democratic supporters in pure shock, i remember seeing on tv "that seat belongs to democrats!!" they thought they didn't have to fight for it and they lost it. clinton thinks she might have this, but can still lose it if she keeps this up. <eos> well there's that, and coakley was a horrible candidate "do you really expect me to stand outside fenway park in the cold in october and shake hands with people?!" i swear that one soundbite cost her the election. <eos> i guess chelsea isn't picking her up from the nursing home. <eos> this is truly remarkable, thanks for posting it. trump is running for office and hillary is playing hide and seek. <eos> i can't support a person so afraid/or unable to face the public and afraid to answer unscripted questions from real reporters. we have a person who is in hiding & wants to lead the country. <eos> she'll skip out on 3rd debate too <eos> i think if she did, it will end her campaighn (she'd nosedive in the polls) and what excuse could she give? she's sick? equally damaging. there is one excuse that might work well, but honestly i don't want to post it for fear she'd use it. dm me if you want to hear it. <eos> apparently she came to seattle yesterday for a fundraiser, she's got that "won't get out of bed for less than 10k" mindset going... <eos> is she dead? she dead, right? <eos> one can hope. well, i hope soros will die first, but hillary is my second choice. <eos> oh gee i really need to hear moby speak <eos> she doesn't want to announce where she'll be as it would be to easy to arrest her. <eos> at this point i can't imagine she'll show up for the final debate. she's screwed if she doesn't, and she's screwed if she does. the very thought of it warms me all over. <eos> i talked to my brother about this and he gave a decent argument that hillary is winning so much that it would be stupid for her to campaign because she can only hurt herself. don't down vote me for this you can check and see i'm based. i just have no other explanation for why a candidate for president literally is not campaigning with less than a month to go. <eos> weathering the wikileaks storm....waiting for it to blow over and avoid being asked anything until final debate. <eos> can you imagine the outrage from msm if trump was taking a break like this? they would run a narrative of him vacationing in russia. <eos> she's taking off so much she thinks she's president already. <eos> too sick to be pres. <eos> she's most likely trying to avoid being asked about the wikileaks as much as possible. and relying on the msm to trash trump <eos> fund raiser for america in the u.k. kind of odd? <eos> does anyone else think this is redicolous? everyone is trying to get into office and she's not even doing anything herself <eos> it's a wonder she's even debating. <eos> #fohma congwessman baahney fwank <eos> mckinnon's clinton was spot on. we'll never see this woman again if she wins. <eos> she's in rehab <eos> this is what hillary will look like at the end of the next debate - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uye3bsh2yja <eos> where'd you go? i miss you so seems like it's been forever that you've been gone <eos> well i gotta say, i wasn't going to support her but if moby tells me he's made his mind up, how can i not support her? mind blown lol <eos> #democrats actually want to elect a dying hag? <eos> nothing to see here. dont look behind the curtain. <eos> she's not well..... <eos> hey, let's be fair here, she made the time to take a trip to vegas! <eos> she is dead or hiding from hitmen. im guessing cia or fbi patriots might try something? <eos> so... we have as much chance to see bigfoot as we do hillary? cool, i like it. <eos> hillary needs to be sent on a long trip to the bahamas if you catch my drift <eos> or belize? <eos> well she has the "delegation of duties" part down pat. just get everyone else to do your jobs for you.....and the libtards think her presidency will be any different? does anyone else think that a sitting president actively campaigning multiple times for a candidate is just wrong on so many levels????? should that be a legal issue, if not an illegal case? i don't know, but it does look really bad for both obama and hitlery! sitting presidents should have no say and not be allowed to say either way what they think about who the next president should be. it makes me so mad that the msm just ignores the fact that obama and michelle had nothing but bad things to say about her before this cycle....and hitlery also had nothing good to say about them.....they are such two faced liers. <eos> honestly they can't risk anyone asking about her emails. too many topics for her to memorize canned responses for. they know she'll fuck it up. <eos> "oh hey she's in that one... oh wait that's the debate. yeah she kinda has to do that one" <eos> and yet no news sources have even bothered to write about this. if trump missed one of his i can only imagine the shit storm he would be facing from cnn and the nyt. <eos> simple really; if we only hear how good she is by other people we aren't seeing her. she isn't well liked and she doesn't have a relatable, likable personality. if she hopes to win she must stay in the shadows.....from whence it came......*cue the twilight zone music. <eos> she was at one with al gore wasn't she? <eos> october 19th, hillary clinton. well, there is one.... <eos> damn i'm disappointed to see chris sacca campaigning for her wtf. so many tech entre's i looked up to are shilling for her makes me really sad. <eos> drug test! we demand transparency! <eos> they are all about fund raising. <eos> chickenshit <eos> she's at home shitting herself over wikileaks reveals <eos> she knows if she goes in public, her poll numbers drop. <eos> woah, woah, woah! she has something scheduled! it's some event called a debate. be honest when you shitpost! (/s) <eos> time to hit the social media and demand she appear in public #whereishillary ???? she won't come out but people are going to doubt her even more. we must plant every seed of doubt possible. make them squirm. <eos> hide all your want you evil witch, i pray to god the righteous verdict of the american people will send you to prison soon. <eos> bu..bb.b..but shes the climate change candidate :( <eos> but is that her public or private policy? or is that the public or private policy of lyin' "abraham" lincoln? <eos> get a life xd <eos> yeah screw hillary. ;). <eos> delete your account. <eos> *100k retweets* omg queen hilldawg \#slay xdd <eos> if she wins, godspeed to what it means to be american. <eos> ctr btfo again <eos> her rally with al gore seems like a joke now(it already was) <eos> anybody remember '[an inconvient truth](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3310137/al-gores-nine-inconvenient-untruths.html)'? <eos> one of the first kind of progressives burned by the clintons was al gore's environmentalists: >within weeks of the "peoples' inaugural" in january 1993, interior secretary bruce babbitt arranged a sweetheart deal on the everglades with the fanjul family, leaving al gore's famous "environmentalist" fans seething and impotent at the first of many, many disappointments. [1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/05/03/the-everglades-forever/fe8a83ec-58e8-4c1d-bbaa-fc5c3c9b361d/) also this is a classic clinton play, make promises to the left while delivering to the right. <eos> manbearpig <eos> hot tip: al gore doesn't believe in climate change either. <eos> "stop consuming dairy and beef products, the methane is killing our ozone!" says al gore, as he eats a great big steak on his private jet <eos> what do you mean he doesn't believe in climate change? do you mean global warming? <eos> the only green they're about is money from big biz <eos> al gore believes only in manbearpig <eos> don't you dare manbearpigsplain to me. <eos> yea, and only he can save the world from manbearpig! <eos> he's super serial about it. <eos> al gore was an early investor, and is heavily invested in green energy but it's not like he has anything to gain or anything. <eos> if al gore actually bought in to his own malarkey, he'd have been calling for the cap of carbon, instead of rallying billionaire investors to cap and trade. <eos> you know what, i'd give it to him. if he has the foresight to look past nonrenewable energy and invest in "green" energy, then good on him. hillary can go fuck herself. edit.) a letter <eos> it's not foresight when you coerce taxpayers to make your investment good regardless of whether it actually is profitable. fuck all of these assholes, gore included. dude never earned an honest dime in his life. <eos> i'm all for a little seed planting by the federal government, esp when the economy needs some jobs (keep people off welfare). kickstart an industry and steal the march on foreign companies/counties so we can export something. and keep the tech and production state side so we don't get undercut by labor 'american made' needs to be the world's standard for green tech <eos> it's actually profitable now, as solar energy is finally more affordable than coal (no subsidy vs no subsidy). edit: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-03/solar-developers-undercut-coal-with-another-record-set-in-dubai now, this coupled with new technology that allows solar panels to be made from carbon nanotubes, and we don't have to rely on china for the rare earth metals. <eos> it is only profitable at end point production (i.e. attached to your home or business as a supplement). renewables are not profitable at grid level because they are unstable and require a coal/gas plant running in tandem. edit: because it seems like you didn't read your own source; that project cost was for one project in dubai and is by far the lowest offer they got. in the article itself it states the project is borderline viable and should not be used as a representative of cost. keep in mind this is projected to be only borderline viable **in the fucking desert** <eos> from india's minister of energy: >one of the consequences of all this ongoing investment in infrastructure is that the cost of providing solar power in india is becoming increasingly affordable – to the point where the country's energy minister, piyush goyal, now says that solar power is a more cost-effective option than the old fossil-fuel staple, coal. >"i think a new coal plant would give you costlier power than a solar plant," goyal told the media at a press conference in india on monday. "of course there are challenges of 24/7 power. we accept all of that – but we have been able to come up with a solar-based long term vision that is not subsidy based." i'm not saying "fuck coal, let's keep it all buried". i'm saying the people who speak so poorly about solar power are in dire need of reading recent statistics and data, as it has become more feasible to create power grids that are the backbone of the provided power. of course, some regions will do better with it than others, but we do have a national power grid (and texas has its own, which has been a huge investor in renewable energy). i just think it's silly to be so against harvesting power from the fucking sun; using what is readily available should be a priority for the american people. it is, of course, something that we can debate as far as to how much money we put into r&d for it, but **as someone that deeply desires energy independence** , i find the push against solar energy wholesale to be detrimental to our nation. <eos> my understanding, please correct me if i am wrong in no way i am saying i am super knowledge able on the subject, if a person wants to set up their own solar grid for their property or house it has a low return of investment because of the initial cost to set it up, i believe in the neighborhood of 30k , and the maintenance required. along with the fact you need a ton of space to have enough panels to harness a significant amount of solar power to actually cover normal energy consumption and not just lower your electricity bill because of inefficiency in storing solar power. however if the government wanted to create a massive solar farm and connect it into the power grid like other countries, i believe germany and argentina or chile, then it would actually be low cost and help with energy independence. <eos> i seriously don't get the hate on renewable resources.... i think solar, wind, wave, geothermal are all awesome! investing in these technologies is a great idea. edit: oh, of course, nuclear should be used for baseline energy needs <eos> its no nuclear which makes all of those look childish in comparison <eos> we should definitely invest in nuclear as well. bigly. <eos> i agree, but there's a difference between people investing in it (free choice) and the government forcing you to pay taxes to invest in it (tyranny). <eos> i'm 100% for them <eos> same, although i can understand the "i don't want to rely on foreign nations for those rare earth metals that solar and wind power require". that's why i'm super excited about carbon nanotubes being used in solar panels. <eos> i'm glad more people are getting into carbon nanotubes. almost all of the research (undergraduate and graduate) i've done has been for single walled carbon nanotubes and i got to present my work at a few ivy league schools. even at ivy league schools most students were woefully unaware of nanotubes. it makes me happy to see it being known by more people now. but the reliance on foreign nations for rare earth metals isn't necessary. they are not actually hard to find, they're called rare because they're almost never found in a pure form. so basically every large nation on earth has access to them very easily. but the easiest and cheapest way to extract it is very messy and hazardous. the world prefers the cheapest option possible so we let china make a mess for them. right now if the us wanted to tell china to eat a bowl of dicks and never pay another cent for rare earth metals we could mine our own. but instead we let our last rare earth mine shut down last year. for instance russia estimated it will take them 5 years to construct the mines to allow them to never have to import from china again (will be completed in 2020). the us could make the same decision today. we just don't. <eos> iirc california has quite a bit of untapped rare earth mineral deposits... also, iirc it's not environmentally friendly to mine them... <eos> no, you should embrace that too. if you've ever wondered why we haven't switched over from copper cables to fiber optics, it's because we're burying those rare metals in *our* country. at some point, copper cables are going to be outdated and wireless communications will be taken for granted. when that day comes, we'll have *tons* of copper and will become the world's supplier of copper. we're like squirrels hiding nuts for the winter. you should embrace those which require rare earth metals, because the us can buy them and re-purpose them later. *that* is foresight. <eos> [removed] <eos> seconded, all the links are behind a paywall. <eos> [removed] <eos> > why all these media orgs don't just link to the fxing source is beyond me. because this quote isn't very damaging in context, and in the same document you have this: >and we need to do-- you know, nuclear, talk about climate change -- nuclear is no greenhouse gas emissions. france has it for nearly 100% of their energy-- they've never had a problem. we've had two problems that people know about: chernobyl, which was a disaster and [inaudible], and you know three mile. right, those were the problems we had. we've come a long way from there. and this: >it's not just pipelines. it's exploding sewer lines. it's broken water lines. it's all of the construction that is under our old cities. it's all falling apart. and so i want a major investment in fixing up what makes our cities work. i despise hillary as a candidate, i don't want her as potus, but holding this document up as evidence of her doing anything wrong is just dishonest. fuck msm and their clickbait. <eos> this doesn't look very damaging to be honest <eos> [removed] <eos> [removed] <eos> [removed] <eos> /u/vitaymin linked the actual source: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9617 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927%23attachments yeah i agree, it's not good journalism to only have secondary sources. i think a place like politico doesn't want to send traffic to wikileaks, it would hurt their clinton monies coming on. ps my phone autocorrects "clinton" to "clinton" constantly, maybe i'm truly a centipede. <eos> get a life is in the attachments of this https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9617 edit: the pro fracking stuff is in here https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927%23attachments <eos> i bet al gore feels like a bit of a douche today then. dragging his uncharismatic backside out of bed to campaign for hillary, only to be told that his little film was boring and that he needs to get a life and crank up the energy consumption! <eos> al gore is a profiteer. he doesn't care about the environment. <eos> al gore is a fake environmentalist, just like obama, hillary, leo, suzuki, etc. they're all corrupt! just look at obama-backed green energy failures. no matter how good their plan is for the environment, it'll fail because of corruption. they act like they care about environment because of $$$. <eos> he knew the whole time. <eos> yep, i was adopting a tone of sarcasm. :) <eos> the whole mother fucking time, they're all liars. out out out!!! <eos> we're reaching the point where it'd be better to dismantle the government and just start anew. <eos> that's why we're voting trump <eos> oops, i know a couple of friends who aren't gonna be happy about this <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_lfbdp8xmu <eos> hrc has been pro-fracking for a long time. i posted this over several comments in the politics sub: > the gsgi was started under the dos in 2010... it led to the us trying to flex chevron in poland (unsuccessfully thanks to the polish protesters despite a lawsuit filed against them). to a lesser degree, in morocco and romania as well but i'm having trouble finding if they were successful initiatives in the end or not >it's pretty well documented the dos was pushing shale gas outside of the us and not in a regulatory manner the global shale gas initiative was clinton's baby while she was at department of state. they shouldn't be happy about the gsgi either but tell them about it and watch the denial that it existed <eos> if they are hillary supporters they will just ignore it, say "theres probably more to the story", and then not care. <eos> my dad and stepmom are voting for hillary and their top issue is the environment. i doubt they even hear about this unless its brought up in the next debate. <eos> trump is pro fracking too. unfortunately. so this really is a non topic for both sides. he literally had ads on my local radio station saying he's pro energy, coal, nuclear, and fracking. gah. <eos> that is sad, fracking is just mindless corruption. profits now! don't care about humans! <eos> jobs, jobs, jobs. <eos> better bring it up then <eos> help us chris wallace. you're our only hope. <eos> no he's not, we're winning <eos> words do matter -h <eos> omg hillary it's you! lol <eos> america is great because america is good! <eos> bye bye bernie voters.. <eos> people's memories are short: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc4pvm6oj4a <eos> this bitch hates everyone. yeah let's elect her, fucking liberals disgust me <eos> dude she's not even a liberal. real liberals hate her guts. she's a globalist who panders to liberals, like how bush/mccain/romney are actually globalists who panders to conservatives <eos> b..but trump called someone fat! muh body positivity! muh genetics!!!! <eos> i don't even agree with some of the people that she hates. i just think that americans deserve representatives, not people willing to use the peoples' mantle to advance their own personal power. <eos> i'm liberal and i'm sure as fuck not voting for her. <eos> how can you fucking vote for a criminal and someone that hates everyone <eos> it's her turn, dude. <eos> but she tells them what the want to hear to their faces. apparently that is what is important to them. <eos> hillary: i will defend fracking as a solution to be more energy independent. saudi arabia & special interests: $$$$$$$ hillary: fracking is evil! it's something that is harming the earth and causes pollution! it needs to stop! <eos> atm redacted is saying everyone has public and private positions, they don't care. the public is to stupid to have elections anymore. <eos> #tremendous hate in her heart <eos> hitler would be proud. <eos> it's true, folks. tremendous hate. <eos> abraham lincoln's fault. <eos> honest abe, that dirty...you know... liar. <eos> running list of hillary and her camp showing contempt and disdain for the american people: thinks **climate change activists** should "get a life." **bernie supporters** are young uninformed naive basement dwellers. **trump supporters** are irredeemably deplorable. they are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic. **bill clinton's rape victims** are a bunch of tramps. **latinos** are needy taco bowls. **blacks** are super predators who need to be brought to heel. also, "blacks always fare badly, irrespective of circumstances". **whites** need to listen better. <eos> asians are in the clear! <eos> someone should make a dank meme out of this. <eos> add the bit about catholics and evangelicals, then post that quote asking who she does like. <eos> yeah, that even got clinton shill megan kelly upset. <eos> just posted this to my fb with (all sources available upon request). gotta get this info out. people are being kept in the dark. they're fucking clueless. <eos> i deleted my fb a month ago. no ragrets <eos> not even one letter? <eos> great list but you forgot: catholicism is a bastardization of the faith and are backwards and uninformed. trump supporters are standard rednecks according to bc 2nd amendment supporters are bitter clingers that's all i got off the top of my head, but i'm sure more will come to me 'member when love trumped hate? <eos> i've heard she called some guy a fucking jew bastard and she also hates "everyday americans" <eos> while i'm she sure does hate everyday americans, no question. that quote from the email was about using it as a phase in a speech. as everything else is 100% right, please avoid that attack, it's not true. <eos> don't forget us catholics. <eos> you forgot christians too man. :p. <eos> it would be easier to name the people she doesn't hate. <eos> sorry to correct the record, but it was only *half* of trump supporters, <eos> that's her *public* position. you don't want to know about her private position. <eos> you mean like, missionary? <eos> it's actually the "cleveland steamer" (don't ask me how i know that) <eos> i much prefer the "rolling brownout" <eos> appropriate username. i will go barf now. <eos> dynamite drop have a up vote <eos> definitely her private position. <eos> this is gold. my bernout friend who has oddly thrown his support behind hillary has been doing so under the false belief that hillary is this great environmentalist option. i've been telling him she doesn't give a fuck about the the environment and this just exposes her true private position compared to her public position. <eos> tell your friend to "get a life." compliments of hitlary. <eos> trump has my loyal support, although i wish he was a bit more pro-environment. but heck, that's still far better than hillary's two-faced bullshit <eos> it's a win win to support really. most of the companies on the higher end of the spectrum have found ways to use green technology to boost profits. implement cost cutting green technology and not the hur dur muh carbon tax bullshit. carbon tax will just be used to create more red tape. use proven green methods and give them a tax break for successful implementation. <eos> he's going to be very pro green energy...i mean our government is literally screwing with someone like elon musk who's done nothing wrong but offer competition on the green energy front. the. horror. <eos> elon musk, litterally iron man. <eos> well there went another chunk of bernie supporters. <eos> oh this is gonna piss off the libs <eos> i was liberal a year ago and this type of double talk changed me big time. i realized i mostly hated conservatives because of the religon tie but well fuck it an atheist republican now. take that oxymoron. <eos> belief in others rights to believe is the most beautiful thing in the world. but hey, i'm just glad your with us. <eos> deist conservative reporting for duty <eos> >*clinton: “but if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. so, you need both a public and a private position.”* clinton: you just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that word, "balance" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment about today. so no transparency....got it... <eos> >i want to defend fracking. no, someone's paying her to defend fracking. she doesnt have her own opinions on anything, it's all about what the big campaign contributors want <eos> full context. not the ko i was hoping for: questioner 1: and now the sierra club won't support any natural gas. and to be honest, not you, but the democrats were so disillusioned with congress on both sides, they expected that -- one we sure as hell didn't expect that we were getting [inaudible] out of the democrats in the energy sector. but it's encouraging-- hillary clinton: well they've come out, and you may not know this, but they've all [inaudible]. i mean i have not said anything about keystone because i wanted to give the president, the secretary a chance to make their decision. but i can't wait any longer. and you know from my perspective, this is just one of these issues-- questioner 2: it's symbolic-- hillary clinton: it's symbolic and it's not going to go away. they're all hanging on to it. so you know bernie sanders is getting lots of support from the most radical environmentalists because he's out there every day bashing the keystone pipeline. and, you know, i'm not into it for that. i've been-- my view is i want to defend natural gas. i want to defend repairing and building the pipelines we need to fuel our economy. i want to defend fracking under the right circumstances. i want to defend, you know, new, modern [inaudible]. i want to defend this stuff. and you know, i'm already at odds with the most organized and wildest. they come to my rallies and they yell at me and, you know, all the rest of it. they say, 'will you promise never to take any fossil fuels out of the earth ever again?' no. i won't promise that. get a life, you know. so i want to get the right balance and that's what i'm [inaudible] about-- getting all the stakeholders together. everybody's not going to get everything they want, that's not the way it's supposed to work in a democracy, but everybody needs to listen to each other. and we need to do-- you know, nuclear, talk about climate change -- nuclear is no greenhouse gas emissions. france has it for nearly 100% of their energy-- they've never had a problem. we've had two problems that people know about: chernobyl, which was a disaster and [inaudible], and you know three mile. right, those were the problems we had. we've come a long way from there. so i'm willing to defend and to really burrow in, i will say, you know, i don't support the keystone pipeline because i don't think we need to do that. i think we need to repair, rebuild, take care of what we've got on the platter here. but i also think that the federal government has to be the partner. you can't do this. i mean whether it's a fed discount window or a new fund, because it's not just pipelines. it's exploding sewer lines. it's broken water lines. it's all of the construction that is under our old cities. it's all falling apart. and so i want a major investment in fixing up what makes our cities work. now, i don't want to leave the rural and suburban areas out, but the oldest -- going back to abraham lincoln -- but the oldest stuff in the ground is in our cities. <eos> that's almost what trump is saying. <eos> > they say, 'will you promise never to take any fossil fuels out of the earth ever again?' no. i won't promise that. get a life, you know. so i want to get the right balance and that's what i'm [inaudible] about-- **getting all the stakeholders together. ** it might not have been a k.o., but combine it with this part as well and the enviromentalists are going to go ballistic anyway. <eos> another appearance by honest abe <eos> 'so ridiculous,' said trump. 'she got caught in a total lie... she lied. and now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great abraham lincoln – honest abe.' directing his response right at his opponent, trump said: 'honest abe never lied. that’s the big difference between abraham lincoln and you. that’s a big difference.' <eos> hilarious hypocritical hillary. <eos> [but....muh carbon credits!!!!!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/004/006/y-u-no-guy.jpg) <eos> i really cant get over the fact that over half the country probably will never know these things because of the media silence <eos> oh man, that's a big one <eos> i just cant bring myself to give a shit about this as a political issue. the only realistic energy choice that isnt fracking or bending over for the middle east is nuclear. i'm for it, but boy nothing pisses off an environmentalist more than saying the word nuclear. they refuse to believe that advancements have been made in nuclear energy tech since 1950. it's a problem science is going to solve, not congress. <eos> [leonardo dicaprio on suicide watch.](https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/02/27003318/gif-of-leonardo-di-caprio-crying-in-this-boys-life-gif.gif) <eos> what does she believe in?! i'll say that i agree that fracking will bring needed revenue into the country. and that climate change cannot be controlled by humans. but dear god, man, this private and public opinion schtick is bullshit. <eos> two-faced hrc <eos> this just goes to show, hillary is making a power grab for her self. do you have any fucking idea how much money is going to be "donated" to the hillary foundation when she becomes president. these leaks show she is a globalist, out to make money for herself. <eos> this is it folks. if any liberal tells you they're voting for hillary you have literally any policy of hers to attack. she's so anti-left she makes the donald look like a leftist. <eos> oh no, i agree with clinton. what is this. d: <eos> you've been infected. was nice knowing you brother. <eos> same, one of the issues i disagreed with bernie on, also gmos. <eos> in fairness, fracking should be defended. unfortunately, there's no reason to believe anything she says one way or the other. <eos> bernouts jump ship <eos> is this the private or public policy? <eos> why is this at the top? its hardly nothing compared to her other scandals? wtf <eos> because this is simple, gets an emotional reaction and she was personally involved. the problem with her other scandals is that there is usually a degree of separation or they're too complicated/boring. <eos> private position: fuck all these losers public position : i love everyone! <eos> to be fair, she's not wrong on this particular point. <eos> please bring this up at the next debate!!! where you at chris wallace??? <eos> idk, she's the devil but if you read the email it's actually pretty good policy. the headline is pretty editorialized. <eos> yeah its sane policy for conservatives and normal americans. but shes not trying to appeal to them. she is appealing to the global warming loons and this will really really hurt with them. fracking is absolutely unacceptable for 40% of democrats. <eos> [what if i show you a picture of a wet polar bear?](https://newswire.net/public/article/e2/25/02/polar-bear.jpg?c=fe68) will that change your mind? <eos> someone needs to make a video or a movie about all of this. sort of like with "the big short", it'll help the average person better understand what's really going on. these leaks and reddit posts are great but the average person isn't reading any of it. <eos> i haven't been there yet but $5 this will not be on r/[redacted]. <eos> felon felon felon felon felon <eos> can't wait to send this to my family members that are voting for hillary because she "will protect the epa and cares about climate change". i can't stand shillary. <eos> i wonder how leo dicaprio feels about this <eos> can we get ken bones take on this? <eos> it's like 5-6 years old technology, man. <eos> so that's her private position. <eos> "look guys, a washed up hag who values corporate money over american lives. let's campaign on her behalf!" -- libtards <eos> the woman will say ***anything*** to ***anybody*** as long as there's something in it for her. even for people who aren't inclined to look too deeply into some of the other issues, this is really clear evidence that she's two-faced. <eos> it's in the attachments of these emails https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9617 https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927%23attachments <eos> wait till healing crystal lady hears about this <eos> i know right? i can't wait to read some savage tweets from her... 😂 <eos> **corrupt** <eos> is there anything this woman is straight about?! <eos> bwhaha! i need to update my list of names she has for each type of american. <eos> **please no second hand sources, especially from politico** <eos> liberals are literally praising this wench as she pisses down their throats. <eos> it's a reasonable stance. too bad she can't be honest and just say it. <eos> kek <eos> #now this is a leak i was waiting for <eos> lol this is too much. all those people shitting on trump for his stance on climate change need to take a cold hard look at this 2 face <eos> trump has so much ammo hes swimming in it. the problem is he doesn't do his debate prep. pence needs to get him in a headlock and drag him into debate prep and just drill this stuff into him for the next 4 days so he can go out there and actually use it. he can use the public/private policy thing as a delivery system and go through every one of the email revelations and ask her if its her private or public position. then turn to everyone and say, she has no principals. she is only in it for the money. give her enough and she will deny climate change too. <eos> no, the problem is the corrupt bought off media is refusing to cover any wikileaks. go to msnbc or cnn website and there is absolutely zero coverage of this and the politics sub mods are paid off so there is zero mention there as well. trump won't be allowed to bring this up at the debate because the paid off moderator wont let him. very sad and very dishonest. <eos> i read an article in the national review that was basically about hillary clinton being the mother of the liberal condescension movement. holy shit it is so true. anyone that doesn't think like her is an [insert new crude comment here]. <eos> countdown to "i don't recall saying that, but if i did i must have, uh, been, uh... you know, joking [insert forced half laugh]." <eos> despite all of the censorship and forced agendas ... i believe in my soul that trump is going to win this november. <eos> to all the bernouts still voting for her, you disgust me. it's bad enough you are voting for more war and more killing innocent people by the state, now it turns out you would be voting against the people fighting for the environment. as the saying goes, if you stand for nothing, you'll fall fall anything. the right thing to do is dismantle this whole corrupt system and we all know it, clinton belongs in jail. <eos> bernout here: there are none voting for her. and we all wholeheartedly want her ass in jail. <eos> some of the cucks at "our revolution" seem to be, which of course means that revolution is a sham. <eos> yea i don't really support what they're doing over there. bernie was the one who pointed out and exposed the establishment on a wide scale. it's just hypocritical as fuck to join them. and no, he wasn't paid off to do so, i genuinely believe he falls for the fear mongering bullshit of "trump bad clinton good". most of us don't fall for it for a second, and will not follow him because we're not fucking sheep. <eos> i'm a bernout also but i got off the bandwagon and switched to trump after new hampshire though. to me it was clear they were not going to let him win and once the blm rally thing came out, i knew he wouldn't fight. i agree, no bernie wasn't paid off, i think he is backing clinton due to fear of getting the blame if trump wins. the democrats would turn him in to a ross perot or ralph nader type figure they can blame. tyt are playing the same stupid game and losing their credibility over it by backing clinton after all they said in the primaries, hypocrites. <eos> hahaha this stuff is great! <eos> the clintons are pretty brilliant in the way they've managed to enrich themselves by pretending to be liberals. but that game is over. <eos> i just ran into this. wonder if it applies. 18 u.s. code § 2071 - concealment, removal, or mutilation generally (a) whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the united states, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the united states, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the united states. as used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the armed forces of the united states. <eos> #hahahahaha this witch is too funny. <eos> i kind of like this psycho, lying, conniving bitch. i mean, not for president, but she'd be a good villain in a movie. she's so over-the-top. almost like a comic book character. <eos> the sad thing is the vast majority of liberals will never hear this and if they do most won't believe it <eos> many liberals have already heard and will continue to hear - enthusiasm for hillary is nil. it will make all the difference in the world. <eos> lol oh shit. <eos> ha, so she even hates her own liberal base. the bernouts have known this for a while, but now it's public. <eos> ken bones takes a coat my dude. <eos> the clinton's don't give a damn about the environment if they can make a buck off it. and the carbon tax is just a big money grab for the super elite who expect to make trillions off it. <eos> she clearly hates everyone. god the american left is so stupid. <eos> what she was responding to was, "will you promise to never take fossil fuels from the earth ever again?" an impossible request at this point in time. <eos> i like the part where she supports nuclear energy only to cite two disasters, forgetting the 3rd - fukushima - which is going to be worse than the other two combined in due time unless japan can figure a way to stop the radiation from going into the ocean. this is damning stuff. shame it won't get any press. to the top! <eos> this is the difference between hrc and dt's campaigns. hrc focuses on 'locker room talk' and spotlights sexual abuse fakers from 10+ years ago to distract voters from the real issues like these. her campaign is falling apart in front of our eyes. corruption, law-breaking, ethics violations, you name it. she's done it. its being exposed. and she is panicking. <eos> #often confused <eos> she's also privately against gay marriage. <eos> she's also privately a climate change denier... <eos> huma must be so disappointed. <eos> > she's also privately ~~against~~ gay ~~marriage~~. ftfy <eos> you could strap one of her supporters to a chair, point them at a t.v, show them all the leaks, emails and read them every word she said and they'd still be like, "dee dee dee she's innocent hurr i'm still voting for her durr this just makes her stronger" <eos> russia! <eos> i'm in massachusetts. i point out the lies, the corruption, the destabilization of countries, the warmongering, how much she wants the corporations and oligarchs to rule the world... and they just say he's racist and call me nasty. they say "yeah but trump will start a war" or "he's just not presidential." nothing i can say or do can convince them clinton is evil, they're are completely and 100% brainwashed by the media and her campaign. my mother even argued americans maybe don't deserve a freedom if we can't handle it! (the argument was over guns). i'm just screaming into a hurricane of denial and willful ignorance. i'm trying my best but my high energy is waning. there's nothing i can do. people on my twitter have even started posting that wikileaks is a russian conspiracy, how can we ever defeat this level of brainwashing? <eos> a great comment i found on another post. a must read! last night a friend claimed that "donald trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth"; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. the one i loved was that, “trump is arrogant.” my friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” to my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “really, what has trump done?” i said, “in june of last year, trump entered the race for president. in just a little over a year, trump has single handedly defeated the republican party. he did so thoroughly. in fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the republican party now suffers from an identity crisis. he literally dismantled the party. trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the bush family. trump has obama petrified that trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law. trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. i doubt mikhail gorbachev liked reagan when reagan said, "tear down that wall." trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the american public by hillary clinton. he has, quite literally, brought hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.” as the press accuses trump of being a house of cards, trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. he has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. george clooney was right when he said trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. thanks, george, you were perfectly correct. what we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. they have no more value. in the same way trump asked the african-american community this question, i asked my friend, ”at this point, what do you have to lose?” we have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #blm, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no god in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. are you really happy with the condition of the current system? one man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. and with everything i’ve written above, you believe trump hasn't done anything? you claim that you are afraid of donald trump? no wonder we’re in trouble. you can say that trump is a lousy presidential candidate. that’s your right. just don’t ever say he’s not effective. that megan kelly, fox news, cnn, msnbc, washington post, rachel maddow, the huffington post, the new york times, raleigh’s news and observer, the ap, don lemon, jake tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the american people against trump, is actually a massive testament to trump. the press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably. here's just one example of how badly america is injured right now. there are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. but, these kids are mimicking nfl stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. now, we have a generation of children who hate america. america’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of america. our problem is that america is on her knee from collective disrespect by americans. you can disrespect america all you want. but, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when hillary calls them “deplorables.” the fact is, they are simply the majority. and now they're no longer silent either. donald trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year. <eos> energy waning? #take another fucking red pill! <eos> show them this video of former soviet union kgb propaganda defector. might wake up them a lot hearing what he said years and years ago being word for word what is occuring now https://youtu.be/bx3ezcvj2xa ^(kgb defector yuri bezmenov's warning to america) >my mother even argued americans maybe don't deserve a freedom if we can't handle it! (the argument was over guns). that is actually the last stage he stated, the last stage is for ***the people to willing give up freedoms and rights*** thinking it's the right thing to do after the previous stage which is ***crisis*** which can be real or fake, this crisis in the us is isis, economic collapse, the impending forced nuclear war with russia. what he is describing is marxism to take complete authoritarian control of an entire nation (or group of nations) which he states takes 15-25 years. hillary has been politically active for 30 years. if hillary wins, be prepared to start building her pyramids 20 hours a hour for rationed food and the right to live <eos> can you imagine the mindfuck from, in one hour long video, going from holding these opinions to realizing that their views are so fucking stupid that russians spies thought they could destroy america by getting useful idiots to believe them. if they were objective enough to be convinced, theyd probably have to be hospitalized while their brain rewires and they relearn how to walk and eat and use the restroom. <eos> he explicitly stated in that video that there is none or very little chance to reverse it but to replace them with a new generation of patriotic citizens all the people helping them achieve this are *' useful idiots '* who get killed off in the last stage, keep in mind we are in the last 2 stages, ***crisis*** and ***give up control/ freedoms*** <eos> remember that this was a soviet plan. i dont think they counted on the ussr collapsing as part of their strategy regarding killing off the useful idiots. <eos> i live in mass and i get the same thing. today i sent a snapchat of me smiling to a old highschool friend with my trump hat and i captioned it: "living the good life". all he sent back was "your ignorant as fuck". idk what i did wrong haha i was just showing him i was happy. also i saw on facebook my best friends mom who's like a second mother to me said that hillary was right to call all trump supporters deplorables. also my own mother said to me "your too good a man to continue to endorse that man [trump]. the level of bias and brainwashing here is insane. <eos> keep fighting. we can't just lie down and let the corporations and oligarchs get away with this. we'd be cucks if we did. even if we stop wasting our time by directly arguing with them, we still have to post the occasional pro-trump post, argue for stuff he supports, and of course vote for him. we have to send a message that there are people who won't bow down to those who want to steal our freedoms. no matter what happens in november, we can't let this movement die like sanders's did. even if it means running for an office ourselves and working our way up from alderman or councilman. <eos> the best way to break brainwashing is with small doubts. you have to confront with small logical inconsistencies. large ones will create larger levels of cognitive dissonance that will make them just shut down. another good way is to insist on not allowing the biased portion into the conversation. frame the conversation such that it cannot include trump and can only include clinton. you have to undermine the view of her separate from building up the argument for trump <eos> you're absolutely right! i used this tactic very successfully as a missionary! changing someone's belief always begins with getting them to doubt their own! <eos> bill's privately against his marriage to her <eos> seems he's pretty publicly against his marriage to her as well; what whit hall the dickin' bimbos and all. <eos> i don't want to know what rapin' bill does in private, to the women who don't agree to stay quiet. <eos> i heard he rapes children on private islands. <eos> hard to confirm if he frequented the lolita express or he'd be in jail. <eos> 26 flights, 5 times without secret service <eos> i think it's pretty public by now. worst kept secret in some time. <eos> bill's privates are rubbing up against a lot of things <eos> a completely understandable position. <eos> still dicking bimbos.. <eos> ..in hillary's bed. <eos> i can't believe that. wouldn't her bedpan and medical equipment get in the way? <eos> hey-oh! <eos> #wew <eos> #laddies <eos> it's getting hawt in here <eos> let's take off all our clothes <eos> spicy! <eos> also wants to implement mandatory drug testing for kids and teenagers on a national level. <eos> but won't take one herself? <eos> of course not, it's law and order for us, martha's vineyard and cannes for them. <eos> wow, i just read the wikileak on that. that would be an unprecedented amount of power by the federal government -- the power to test its citizens and to put them in medical detention facilities (euphemistically called "treatment centers") so that they can ensure that we are double-plus compliant in the future. <eos> hillary clinton's america. you can bet your ass the profits made by the "treatment centers" would kick back to the clinton foundation. chelsea needs a bigger pied-a-terre. <eos> give me a source, i need this. <eos> https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9373 <eos> holy fucking shit, op was not exaggerating. this is fucking disgusting and terrifying. how the fuck is this not getting plastered all over??? <eos> whoa holy shit that's awful. throw me a source so i can add it to my database of "fucked up shit she does!" <eos> what the fuck, source? that's totalitarian shit right there <eos> [removed] <eos> https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9373 <eos> so the american academy of pediatrics, which hillary supports, wrote this up? and they decided to scrap it and see if it passes legislation later on? sounds dastardly. <eos> if any body is looking for it, it's closer to the bottom of that thread <eos> besides the email it was discussed in. <eos> we suspect your post is a troll post. your post has been removed. *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/the_donald) if you have any questions or concerns.* <eos> profiteering from drug test manufacturing. they must be big donors to her. <eos> quest diagnostics is a big one, we should check to see if they are donors to cf <eos> quest does the mlb testing. <eos> how about directly to hillary herself? : http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000028499 jeb! and bernie got several grand from quest as well <eos> it is classed as from individuals though. this means that employees of quest are giving the money. <eos> i've gotten "lectured" by dimwits in /r/trees about this before, and they all have the same stupid retort: "mike pence is 10 million times worse for weed".. get ready for this to be their only comeback. i can't comment on it as i am canadian and know literally nothing about pence <eos> pence has said literally nothing about weed. lol <eos> so why are these brainless goombas constantly using that as their only retort when this argument comes up? i'd like the proper response for the next time i encounter this argument when playing the weed angle <eos> because the vice president supercedes the president. they have smoked themselves retarded <eos> yeah but obviously this guy is going to have a massive influence, you don't think? <eos> vp does nothing to influence p, sorry to break it to you. just look at the past 5 vps, sure they accomplished some, but it was never interrupting something their p strongly believed in lol <eos> not enough to overturn trump's policy of letting states decide <eos> cool, well i hope that's true then.. because i personally would be voting based on this one issue alone, i take it that serious <eos> lmao <eos> im a huge stoner and i think the war on drugs is possibly the most corrupt thing about the us, but you soley vote on weed legalization? that's fucked <eos> yeah i e-campaigned over there for a week (helped encourage the mods to get the mega thread going). honestly, i got some pretty decent upvotes at the time, but the overall consensus is anti-trump. it's extremely unfortunate since many of these people support and obviously want legalization, yet they unwittingly follow a party who has notoriously doubled our prison population and will prefer federal law over state rights. with that said, hillary does not intend on helping change this federal law. and in reality, trump might not care to change the federal law either, but he is 100% behind the states making their own decisions on the matter. so, it's a no brainer to me.... <eos> good thing weed makes you incredibly lazy and unmotivated. a liberals none vote is a vote for trump. <eos> you have bought into the reefer madness! <eos> idk about that man. you ever clean your house on a sativa? lol like a zen work monster <eos> ever seen a 20 dollar bill....on weed??? <eos> shouldn't matter since the trump pence campaign has made it abundantly clear that pence is going to support trumps platform even if it goes against his personal ideology, and trump has made it clear he will not hinder the states' decisions even if he won't support national legalization. <eos> i remember trump saying that he was 100% for the full legalization of medicinal marijuana, and leave recreational up to the states. edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwiqhdbs1g8 <eos> i didn't know if their argument had merit or not.. as i said, it's literally their only comeback.. they all just whine that pence is way worse. <eos> i wasn't trying to argue with your comment. just adding to it. <eos> cheers! <eos> yeah, because just look at all in influence creepy uncle joe biden has had with obama. <eos> he does love 2 cuddle <eos> i'm sorry i'm missing your reference? <eos> vice president joe biden is irrelevant, so why would trumps vp's opinion hold as much weight as the other party's presidential candidate <eos> because the elites could kill trump. even so, i think pence would still follow along with donalds plan <eos> nobody can kill trump since trump is an elite but the best part is he actually gives a shit about us normal non-elite folk and has since well, forever, as is documented in how many activist things he has done for minorities like blacks, gays and women <eos> /r/the_redacted wouldn't want you to know that though. <eos> she's owned by big pharma. of course she's against legalization. she's also owned by the banks, saudi arabia, qattar. big business and foreign country's are 90% of her campaign donations. do your own research on the candidates and don't pay attention to what the media says, wiki leaks has already exposed that clinton absolutely controls them. just watch, in about two minutes this thread will be flooded by correct the record folks downvoting and saying hillary is the second coming. <eos> if you live in colorado, get campaigning on this. trump's position is to let the states decide, which colorado has done. shillary's is to overrule the states. could be a big issue in colorado. <eos> donald said in an interview back in 1990 that he thought we should legalize drugs and use the taxes to discourage drug use and take money out of the hands of the cartels. my guess is that he still holds this view but wants to take a more gradual approach towards it. can you imagine how r/trees would be circlejerking about any other candidate who had given an interview like this. >[trump] said that legalizing drugs is the only way to win the war against what he considers to be one of america's most serious problems. >trump blamed the country's drug problems on politicians who "don't have any guts" and enforcement efforts that are "a joke." >"we're losing badly the war on drugs," trump said. "you have to legalize drugs to win that war. you have to take the profit away from these drug czars." >trump said tax revenues from a legalized drug trade could be spent to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. >in an interview, trump said he felt it was an appropriate time to broach his ideas "because south florida has such a huge problem with drugs." >"what i'd like to do maybe by bringing it up is cause enough controversy that you get into a dialogue on the issue of drugs so people will start to realize that this is the only answer; there is no other answer," trump said. <eos> lol when the democratic candidate is more conservative than the republican candidate. <eos> it's not that she's more conservative, she is beholden to big pharma, which sees the legalization of weed as a threat to profits. <eos> weed rulz hillary clinton sux <eos> https://i.redd.it/3iipx32f2frx.png https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927 (see attachment) <eos> the dea can be easily weaponized to use against her opponents just like the fbi being used against the tea party. she'd never want to lose that from her bag of tricks. <eos> the reason that she is against legalization is because keeping pot illegal, benefits her mexican narco terrorist amigos, who launder their illicit drug money through her foundation. <eos> you do realize that snoop is a mod of r/trees and has already endorsed clinton, right? <eos> must of been before shit hit the fan. <eos> talk about stupidity. <eos> a link to the email might be more effective. <eos> there is no email she's said this publicly. <eos> wasn't there one talking about it is an untenable political position? which is worse as it's yet another example of her being an unprincipled follower. <eos> chelsea hubbell also said that her mother was strongly against legalization of marijuana. <eos> > https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927 (see attachment) <eos> "it okay because trump is such a creep" /s <eos> if this hits frontpage it's over <eos> it's probably to help people she might know in the logging industry as hemp is a huge competitor and can be used for everything from paper to rope. <eos> coming from r/all, what's trump's stance? sources online give different points of view, and i would like to be pointed to the right direction. <eos> he wants to make medicinal marijuana legal and leave it up to the states to decide for recreational use. he's said this many times in his speeches about the fed's overreach and the benefits of medical marijuana. iirc, one of his employee's child suffered from a chronic illness and the marijuana help them to be able to enjoy life while taking care of the symptoms from the disease. <eos> [deleted] <eos> this is about a different person... read the context. <eos> these fucking stoner idiots are so entrenched that they're not even allowing us to post any anti-hillary posts in their subs. i smoke too...to relax and open my mind. there doesn't seem to be enough weed in the world for them to see the truth. <eos> dear /r/trees, we have cookies and coats. sincerely, /r/the_donald <eos> we're still allowed to mention other subreddits? <eos> **dude** <eos> **weed** <eos> they don't care. for them the most important thing is stopping the new "literally hitler." <eos> upvote!!! stay the fuck out of my medicine cabinet killary. we're doing just fine here in colorado without your big government interference. same goes for you governor christie. fuck off. <eos> in all honesty /r/trees is a pretty lousy sub. 90% of the posts are people showing off their gear or 12 year olds asking how to cover up the smell. if anybody is looking for a good weed subreddit, give /r/eldertrees a try. <eos> oh man, all i ask for is a trump presidency and the legalization of medical marijuana in my state. :, ( <eos> need some memes on this... <eos> /r/weed too m8 <eos> she's doesn't want to reduce her revenue from the mexican cartel. <eos> i wonder why?!?!?!?!? <eos> people of washington and colorado also need to realize that barack obama said legalization would be a disaster.... sure doesn't look like it! police are focusing on real crimes instead of petty marijuana possession <eos> /r/trees is with her. <eos> not all... <eos> there goes the bernie vote, and the black vote! <eos> she's also for fracking and think tree hug gets need to get a life. <eos> we are aware.... <eos> does trump have an official written stance on legalization i can point to? <eos> i feel like everyone here knows thid <eos> i like smoking weed but everyone on trees is how you say pretty fucking dumb. <eos> i'm also just fine with states figuring it out first - and i work in the industry. the last thing these small businesses need is wal-mart stepping in at this stage. it's inevitable - but things are just getting going and a there's a ton of issues that need sorting out. legal cannabis is making huge strides, but there's a lot of bug fixing along the way. it's like racing a car that's still being built and designed around you every time you go into the pits. exciting is an understatement. <eos> i just wish it was happening faster in texas :( <eos> the laat thing we need is walmart stepping in and trying to sell this new dangerous stuff called 'beer' either. moron. <eos> your beer isn't even american anymore. i'd like a year before the multinationals fuck up cannabis. thanks, bye. <eos> we still have microbrews and there's are a couple of breweries that have been around for a long time here. i wouldn't say our beer isn't american at all. quite the opposite really. <eos> you can split hairs with someone else - blocked. <eos> what a fucking cuck. only been a redditor for a day, probably a ctr shill. can't even handle the truth like $hillary supporters. <eos> trump is vehemently against the legalization of marijuana too <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwiqhdbs1g8 <eos> http://www.westword.com/news/donald-trump-on-big-problems-with-co-pot-laws-flip-flop-on-legalizing-drugs-6992369 <eos> i'm not a single issue voter, and i'm going to smoke if i want no matter what. she isn't going to have many options when a bunch of other states legalize in november, so i'm not at all worried about that aspect of her presidency(she's pretty much won the election, and no crappy leaked emails are going to change that ;) ). <eos> deport! <eos> this is a rally, what the fuck are you watching <eos> i did not realize that my question posed an intellectual challenge. i am sorry. :-) <eos> my mom is pretty terrible with us politics tbh. all she knows is indian politics, and how she wants a stalinist leader to lead the revolution in india. that said, i would vote trump (tfw you're still 17) because i can't stand for hillary's policies, past actions, and potential sc nominees. i couldn't care less how terrible they are as a person, they just have to deliver in policy. if trump wins and ends up fucking up in his policy, i won't vote for him in 2020. simple as that. <eos> yeah bleachbit this shit yo <eos> ofcourse there are many instances like your grandfathers. probably there is something about the water in america that just makes you work hard? :p <eos> ḵ̴̢̹̠̳̞͕͎̲̙̯é̷̸̷͖̲͎͈̪͚̮̣͓̻ͅk̛̠͙̗̪͔̜̜̳͚̲̮̟͎͈͜͢͡ <eos> it sucks when you can't trust anyone in government or media to be honest. <eos> i'd add in a dash of the ever lovin thing, because nov 8th will be clobberin time! <eos> we love you fbi good guys! <eos> /r/kratom should also know, considering how much kratom's been under fire lately. once again, trump's been on record saying the war on drugs is silly. and considering the heroin epidemic our country's going through, we outright need the legalization of kratom and marijuana. then again, if you think lives being destroyed by horrible, unregulated, filthy, expensive drugs brought to you by cartels that lead to violent crime en masse is a-ok, then by all means, vote for hillary. actually, don't. get the fuck out of my country. <eos> nah... it'll take a few days for them (buzzfeed) to clear out the inboxes from what 4chan did... <eos> if you have mpb, yes. <eos> i'll promote trump for free. better yet, take my money!!!!!! <eos> positive for maga :/ <eos> pretty much. <eos> socialized medicine is never better. prying control of politicians by the pharmaceutical cartel away from them will go a lot farther. <eos> trump doing what he does best. playing 4d chess while everyone else is playing checkers. <eos> she'll feel fit, after the blood transfusion. lol. <eos> i'm ignoring the silly stuff and listening to him. <eos> this is some ignorant ass shit right here. of all things one issue should never decide the votes of individuals <eos> we need wall, train and coat. those 3 are the best <eos> maga 10 feet higher <eos> #a better wall than china's.

it's hard to blame russia for supporting india when people don't recognize india as the superpower that it is. i'm not saying that russia hasn't influenced the current state of india; i'm saying that we should treat india as the superpower that they are and work with them economically because they share similar interests. they have a nuclear program, they have a space program, they function on a capitalist society. yes, there are parts of india that are awful and people do not deserve to live and die in the slums. but we should not turn our heads to what we disgust, we should help our fellow brothers to fix their problems. <eos> i chose to live in the cheapest apt complex i could find in my town which ended up being amazing because all the indian it contractors chose to live there too lol. happy families and no crime. <eos> true americans people right here folks. <eos> #build the wall <eos> 10 feet higher. no brakes. get this man a coat. those 3 and no further. <eos> #[you just activated my trump card.](http://i.imgur.com/ru8jbtl.jpg) [trump's wall just got 10 feet higher! *high energy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qligom24qqc) #total height: 241410ft. we are 80.47% of the distance of hillary's emails if we had 10ft for each one (300000ft)! 58590ft remaining. ***** bot by /u\/tonysesek556 - [about page](https://aws.wariomissed.com/thewallgrows/) - **[taking suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbt77un01wxb3opvwc8llesd1e8jqj5mnkhitd4qqqk/viewform)** - /r/the_donald ***** if you don't want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you, please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist! <eos> also some still shots of her clothing from certain angles. google images... <eos> that's a sub-category of hacking called 'social engineering'. <eos> trump will be delivering his speech tonight in 26 languages - all of them *english*. <eos> #can we get an 'i don't recall bot' <eos> it's a third party, so she deny responsibility. <eos> amen my friends. <eos> nazi <eos> >pander kek. <eos> trump is the chess master of playing 4d chess <eos> the eyes on that pepe... right to the soul. <eos> ohhh..i hate to say it, but restrict the bots to just the wall one and the coat one until the election. moment that trumps announced, bring -all- of them back #i want to say one sentence and have five bots speak after the god-emperor is crowned <eos> calls himself a commentator <eos> and killary has never served this country in any capacity for the good of the united states. her expertise is in money and favors for entities that seek only more money and favors. #maga <eos> if hillary is the first president we won't have a country anymore <eos> > my fear is if hillary wins as the first woman president, we won't have another woman for awhile. it's a justified fear. google julia gillard and look at how controversial she was as australia's first female pm. i doubt there will be another one for at least twenty years. <eos> you guys didn't know that? rosa parks and muhammad ali were racists, which makes trump racist by standing together with medals. <eos> as for the doctor, trump seems quite like 12 and 4 in his seriousness of getting stuff done, 4 in his zingers, 3 in his gentleman image, and 2 in his hair (sorry, trump's defly got funny hair). <eos> i know one like this. makes me so sad. <eos> i've had to specifically distance myself from a hilbot coworker since about 2 months ago. privately i despise her.

well, they brought it on themselves by whoring themselves out to hillary and co. <eos> so more like harley quinn? <eos> twitter link? <eos> i am one of the 750k! <eos> it's nice to be a part of something so large...bigger than woodstock. <eos> we can make a yuuuge impact on her numbers--remember, just as o'reilly is ending, immediately turn off the tv or switch the channel before her show even begins. then, click fox back on for hannity. fox will soon get the message, loud and clear! <eos> yeah... that's not how tv ratings work <eos> is that how it works? i thought you have to be registered to be part of the sampling for the nielsen ratings? <eos> switch on to fox business. so much better. hobbs **based** <eos> also, keep sending them emails telling them to fire her. <eos> i've called fox about this several times, i only watch hannity now. let them know: 888-369-4762 they know things are bad if people take the time to contact them, takes 30 seconds. also email hannity@foxnews.com and let him know we want him back at 9pm and for two hours. <eos> make a separate post!!! so everyone can see this. <eos> i tried to leave a comment but it said their voice mailbox was full. i'll try again in a little bit. <eos> seems that email i posted was not right, i've been calling and not emailing and i just looked that up, sent an email to sean just and it bounced. <eos> judge jeanine is legit too. she's probably my favorite even over sean. <eos> she is horrible. her twitter is all about bashing trump. <eos> i wish she would bash my penis with her vagina, but no... she is so selfish. <eos> this is such sweet, sweet victory! <eos> snow white should just stop pretending and go to cnn already <eos> she's just horrible <eos> just go to cnn megan, cunt <eos> people actually watch [ratchet maddow?](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1499446228/msnbc_headshot_400x400.jpg) <eos> i always turn her off. i hate her. and i'm a chick. <eos> from an autist moron what does the numbers mean ? <eos> it means she has lost 750 thousand people watching her show, which is bad. <eos> no i meant the random number like 3.25 the ratings on the website <eos> suppose it means 3,250,000 people are tuning in possibly? <eos> since when is bill behind ac in viewership? <eos> the top numbers are for a certain age group only. the bottom numbers for total viewers show that he is still killing it! <eos> hannity is killing it! <eos> representing 1 of the 750k <eos> i agree with this. <eos> first woman to go down in history by shedding blood in the natural way <eos> how can a woman be so sexy, but so repulsive. i can't watch her because it sends my brain and dick into a war internally. i'll find myself with the thumb above the button to go away from fox news, but i linger for 5 minutes because she's fine. <eos> how about we just let hannity take over fox news whenever he has something to talk about? he can pass it off to tucker when they want to kill time. <eos> i say turn the channel the second her show comes on -- don't support her in anyway. be sure to turn it back on for our friend hannity though. <eos> the two sons who took over at fox love her and think that she is the future of fox! i'm afraid that when the contracts are over for the other shows, that they will be replaced with a bunch of libs. <eos> fucking replace her with hannity and fill the gap with lou dobbs for god's sake. <eos> i will start turning on fox news for other anchors and turn it off just for her. i won't even be watching most of the time. <eos> move hannity to 9 eastern, give 10 eastern to milo and other conservatives on a rotating basis. <eos> does milo have a show? <eos> lol milo is an embarrassment to conservatism, he's not even conservative. <eos> yeah he just wants to make money. <eos> milo is just an opportunist as we saw on this sub a few months ago. <eos> how do they measure viewers? i don't watch any of those shows, but if it made a difference i would turn on bill o'reilly just to turn off megyn kelly. <eos> cable can see how many viewers and they count the dvr recordings too. <eos> your cable box will ping the data. i assume they also count streaming numbers too. <eos> reminder that rachel maddow, the one who is beating megyn kelly in the ratings, spent 10 continuous minutes of primetime [talking about pepe the frog and how he is a symbol of white supremacy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okoaqcomyx8) <eos> this makes me so happy :) <eos> me too can't stand that hill shill pos she used to get wet thinking about rrruuubbiiiooo <eos> i would watch the fuck out of 2hr hannity. <eos> judge pirro or monica crowley to replace megyn <eos> just give him an extra hour every night to read off the wikileak emails. <eos> the kelly file -- aka -- the time to surf around other stations to find out what smack is being talked about trump. <eos> 'pin the accusation on the mean person' while playing with ice cubes. <eos> ummm <eos> but that's the challenge. say something coherent and get as many bots responding as possible. <eos> godspeed patriot! we are *all* american heroes when we choose to shed light on the corruption that denigrates us all. <eos> how do people usually pronounce based? base as in basically, or base-ed? <eos> #pepaaaay <eos> 10/fucking10 <eos> #ten feet higher <eos> 4d chess master activated <eos> or a soldier 76? (overwatch hijack, sorry) <eos> it's not saying much but she's definitely better looking than the last few hags <eos> to answer your question, "the ends justify the means" <eos> i agree. every single attack is being used to prop hillary up (pun intended). "trump supporters hate women and don't want a woman president" - what they say. meanwhile, i really don't care about gender or race. i just want someone that is going to fight for americans. <eos> patel is very common last name. like smith here. fun fact - most of the motel owners in the us are now patels. google "patel motel" <eos> who would obama be? the superfriends version if toyman comes to mind. <eos> he's the grandmaster of 4 d chess.....fact <eos> thank you! you are 100% right. <eos> 4+ years old too <eos> it's incredible when i reflect upon it... i hated this man 8 years ago when our current president, barry "okie doke" obongo, was elected. i now see him as one of the last bastions of hope and truth in our corrupted landscape of american journalism. <eos> i think that while it's physically possible, it would be completely unpractical. not only would it take a huge amount of money, but most of the largest companies in the world are oil companies. you would have to deprivatize the energy industry and fund alternative stuff with taxpayer money, which would require a huge tax hike. those large companies would lose a lot of money, and thus cut a lot of jobs. combine raised taxes with job losses and you have a recipe for an economic disaster. <eos> wikileaks hour by the fire with hannipede.. brought to you by truthy tendies..the tendies with a hint of spice <eos> i quit watching her months ago. i wish fox could trade her to cnn for kayleigh mcenany. i love her. <eos> donald trump is a sociopathic sex pest! am i doing it right? <eos> i don't mind nominal muslims. like, people who don't eat pork or whatever. but anyone who legitimately believes mohammed is a paragon to emulate i'm suspicious of. <eos> hillary clinton also was awarded this medal in 99. <eos> top kek <eos> yikes, she must be really sick. <eos> lol yea that's not how that works. you need a nielsen box or survey. i was sent a nielsen survey in june. you just track your viewing habits for the week. <eos> fox will sprial to thier death just like all the other msm outlets <eos> dopey is too nice of an adjective to describe randal maddow. <eos> agreed with this, lou has a very

to bash head against wall. (i grew up shooting but never owned a gun) * started listening to more educated conservatives instead of the the social/religious conservatives. * started reading books about people that served this country instead of books bitching about this country. etc, etc. <eos> [you have my nsfw upvote...](http://adultimg.site/bvh.gifv ) <eos> the mods say that they let the community produce content. which i actually believe. what is happening is they're being bombarded by a private company to only promote hillary and squander any info against her. the mods aren't equipt to handle all the shills. the all actual admins who are paid by reddit that have the tools to stop it are in my opinion without a doubt taking money in to let these companies promote and demote content. which is absolutley disgraceful. <eos> https://www.google.com/search?q=smug+pepe+shirt&client=ms-android-google&sa=x&biw=412&bih=604&noj=1&tbs=vw:g,ss:9&tbm=shop&srpd=11889585598686900898&prds=num:1,of:1,paur:clkaskrax7kthyrssdi6oxjvxkfgvydgo1k0w0olr4mxtuef2q03bldsadvqvugszfxss17oh47xhvafeimr0istp92dbcqc_9uhvkt40encfdagcphnq-kxarizafpvh71kncquhqlriv3kakj5b94gf-vwlq&ved=0ahukewi8o5kgkt7pahvb7sykhwmmcakqgjyilqmwaa <eos> thank you, come maga. <eos> i'm not doubting what you're saying but do you have any sources for those stats on entrepreneurship rates, higher education attainment rates and earnings rate of any racial group for indians in the us? <eos> "we" <eos> that's why they're freaking out and threatening to leave the country. lmao <eos> got it. i did notice those two things, you're right. <eos> jill, you say that like it's a bad thing. <eos> she has 2.5m just because o'reilly, if you put her at 7p she'd have 200k <eos> think we need a few more of these in the next few weeks. <eos> lol, trump has finally blown it, and now your collective attention turns abruptly towards media conspiracy theories. enjoy fellas! <eos> i had to lol <eos> always sean! he's the best. no bullshit. <eos> also sprach zarathustra: ein buch für alle und keinen now if we could just get people to read it. <eos> cnn: donald trump caught stealing rosa park's medal and handing it over to kkk while muhammad ali witnesses tragic incident - trump campaign has yet to comment <eos> indians also have an unexplainable affinity for anything gold, perhaps only matched by jews. they see donald's hair and that's all they care about dont kid yourself panjeet <eos> yeah, few people know the dangers of islamists better than indians. <eos> yo how many people you got??? also where guys lets send them some pizza!!! keep it up! <eos> don't ever trust sean hannity, don't ever trust foxnews. he might seem like he's on your side, but he was the one the staunchest pro-bush doctrine war, pro-iraqi war lies about saddam nukes and other nonsense that started the domino effect that's led us to isis and 1 million refugees 12 years later. <eos> > this is gonna trigger the cucks evidently donald triggered her cock. <eos> deadpool, of course. a madman taking on entire armies and dropping dank memes while dropping bodies. <eos> is there any indication that the presidents emails were classified? <eos> we have to remember andrew jackson(democrat party founder) used his influence in politics to buy out indian land at a deep discount. how you ask? he used soldiers/police to go in and "negotiate" a very reduced price on the land. indians hated him. he is responsible for almost 13+ states worth of land being bought by himself + others in total. a very interesting thing to research if you have the time, dinesh dzousa in hillary's america lays out it very well. in short, democrats always cheat and use state power to benefit. <eos> lower taxes, anti islamist. that's reason enough. <eos> i elect it needs to be turned off on serious threads. <eos> no. no you're not doing it right at all. <eos> i'm in! <eos> damn. wish i had that opportunity. i would negotiate for more money, endorse, do a tell all the next day, donate the money to charity. what are you gonna do hillary? i don't recall signing anything! <eos> pathetic. /u/ethantg shows the influence youtube has. <eos> send in the dice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wllslb-royo <eos> we need to do this at voting offices or something. we need high attention on all vote counting! we need to make sure they know we are watching everything. <eos> cnn is the national enquirer of tv journalism. <eos> i don't even understand. is this really representative of this subreddit? michael obama? what the fuck? <eos> who is this guy? he looks familiar. anyone have a link to that video on youtube? <eos> my grandfather and grand mother came legally, but them stayed illegals wayyyy longer than they should have <eos> michelle is playing checkers while trump is playing 4d chess <eos> i thought we were in it for the syrian oil fields? <eos> thank you, i was looking for this very pepe earlier today. <eos> i may stop you watching fox new because of her <eos> like, with clorox? <eos> casey directly worked for obama's election campaign. he's a huge lib, so i wasn't suprised this, he probably would have done it for free, but it was oddly out of his normal style of video to demand political action by the youtube community, so yeah, he probably made something off it <eos> i want to see barrack obama holding a sign that reads: "donald trump touched my pussy". <eos> you know you're a centipede when you have to bring a sleeping bag to hide your woody when trump comes on stage. <eos> i can't watch her since she cut her hair. she was good first month then started reading from producer scripts and is now openly hostile towards the donald and is pro hillary. i'm done watching megan kelly. <eos> who add these images? are they to hurt trump? <eos> ayyyy. indians for trump. trump must win. as an indian, we can't handle another pakistani terrorist loving president. <eos> #take my high energy, patriot!!!! <eos> "hey guise what's up leafy here and you guise should fucking...fucking...just fucking guise...hillary...i mean shit...fucking hell you guise....hillary fucking clinton....fucking vote....leave a fucking awesome like and guise subscribe." <eos> wow that hashtag sure showed them! well done, boys. <eos> [it's like you didn't even try!](http://www.redbubble.com/people/kyhro/works/14876966-pepe-face?grid_pos=95&p=t-shirt&style=mens) <eos> fucking hindus and their white supremacy <eos> **why isn't #whereshillary trending?** <eos> no he's literally worse than hitler and !~~hillary~~ robothitler combined <eos> phil seems very unbiased and tends to just state what is known in most situations. msm should use him as an example <eos> hrc also tested attacks on obama about his use of cocaine. saw it on fox news yesterday. <eos> somebody post the address and info of the next protest so reddit can donate pizzas to the protestors, i'll chip in $10! <eos> you must be new here. <eos> i lot of people like to talk shit about hannity, including people on the right, but the simple fact is - he is the only one saying the things that need to be said. - o'reilly is doing his best to concern troll so he can appear middle of the road to conservatives. ditto krauthammer who seems still butthurt that trump won the primaries. hey k-hammer, it's either trump or crooked hillary, you're smart enough to make that decision without needing to ponder it. - bret baer isn't bad, he's at least covering wikileaks, but he's also giving the bullshit trump accusers story equal ish air time. and brit hume is similarly milquetoast. - megyn kelly has had her jimmies so rustled by trump that she's almost completely lost objectivity. - and as for the msm, they're engaging in one of the most stunning displays of cognitive dissonance i've ever seen. that leaves hannity as the sole voice of reason saying "hey america, are we seriously considering electing a criminal!?" <eos> fyi nyt is owned by carlos slim that makes a killing off money sent back to mexico through credit agencies <eos> well dressed man, super cute kid, elegant wife. <eos> here in california and as our sikh friends who they are voting for and with a smile they will respond " mr trump of course" . illegal aliens feel like indians are the illegals and make fun of them, urinate on their business, hang out in front. they want to make an honest dollar working and don't want any drama. <eos> but guuuuuys what we do is really important.... covering trump made up accusations wall to wall is vital to america.... come on guys like me i'm blonde, pretty lawyer. no need to cover that actual political corruption of the front runner must destroy trump. i'm important <eos> wikileaks has confirmed everything she stands for is bullshit but the idiotic voters don't care, they've been manipulated by the **dishonest media** so much that they think trump is the true enemy. they'll learn. <eos> the polls are bullshit. those that still follow her are fucking retarded, or think they have a spot in the corruption. oversampling democrats by 16, and women by whatever it is now... the bernie bots are likely discouraged or voting trump, and she will come nowhere near obama's support 2012. we'll either get a trump landslide or they'll use these fake polls to steal it on soros' machines. obamas, gore, kaine... everyone is campaigning for her... except her. she has no real support, and nowhere near enough to beat trump. it's trump or steal. vote <eos> i know 4 former bots and for what it's worth 1 is voting for hillary, 2 are voting for trump, and the last probably won't vote. they are all bitter as hell about the primary, but the hillary one is deeply in san francisco. <eos> man they're going to really fuck our country up. are there any based countries to move to that i won't have to constantly worry about being raped or killed by peaceful islamists? <eos> they already did in the last two elections <eos> so nothing should come of this election if hilary wins? she seems like she's willing to pass tpp and tisa and i feel like we're fucked if they pass <eos> that's because her idiotic supporters get their news from comedy central and hbo <eos> they truly do. i have seen them mention the daily show as a news program (along with cnn) here on reddit. <eos> approval of tpp alone is enough to not vote for clinton. only trump will make america great again! turn off the msm and think really hard for a minute of what your doing if you are leaning towards clinton. nobody should be voting democratic this election! <eos> can we get a link to the actual email from the excerpt picture? <eos> nevermind, found it: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5498 <eos> hillary is lying, i am in shock!!! good day sir. <eos> clinton is trying to get another nafta, its like she intentionally wants to destroy us economy. <eos> lol. public position vs. private position. classic crooked. rot in a jail cell old lady. <eos> i'm shocked. shocked!!! <eos> obama admin upgrades malaysia on human trafficking to preserve their spot in tpp. http://web.archive.org/web/20161015024227/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/malaysia-human-trafficking-tpp_us_55b66521e4b0224d8832fe28 <eos> the god-emperor said so himself at this event and that's good enough for me <eos> india on the other hand <eos> rolling stone next week: i was raped by trump's deplorables the harrowing (and totally true this time) story of rape <eos> he said 20 in a post above <eos> even if it was a clinton paid for ad, there's nothing illegal about paying an actor to be in a video. look at the donald trump ads, do you think they didn't get paid to be on the video? <eos> no, in all honesty-- everybody in caseys circle are clinton sjw hyper evangelicals. he's incredibly close with the people over at vox. i'm sure his opinion would be entirely the same with or without a paid endorsement. <eos> don't know about him being based....but glad he's at least mentioning it enough to prompt his viewers to check alternative media to verify. <eos> hey you know, they did nothing wrong? they got nothing to fear. let's have a good old-fashioned witch hunt for corruption. long overdue. <eos> that hindi girl is hot asf! <eos> ain't isn't a word <eos> buy my app! buy my app! <eos> i don't have twitter, but i've been spreading the message on facebook. **where the fuck is crooked?** <eos> #big fan of hindu <eos> trumpcollider energy level 6.9 tev <eos> thank you guys!! <eos> you know, let's say it is the russians. it's not immediately obvious, but if so this should be actually read as a strong endorsement of trump for americans. if they are backing trump, it is not because he's some kind of russian shill, but because they don't want a candidate who will heat up agressions with them, which is equally sensible for americans. think about it; clinton has been proven to sell us interests out to despotic russian allies (uranium one)--she would be the most sensible choice from their perspective. except that she and her ideologic allies in the white house are practically egging russia on. <eos> funny 8 of their parents owned hotels. super nice folks as well. <eos> why are you sorry? it's not about which countries other than we're encircling russia. americans would be nitrate if russia pulled them same shit. <eos> make it 4 for trump https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10669#efmak3ambanzapkaq7atg > frankly i thought it was dumb for mccaskill and gutierrez to be attacking bernie. > we are going to need his voters to turn out in november for hrc, he won't be > nominated. i am doing the opposite, repeatedly writing friendly and positive > pieces about bernie as an hrc supporter, and when the time is right i will have > money in the bank with him and his people as a liberal to urge them to come out > in force to vote for hrc.....which is not a given, and we won't have much margin > for error in a close election.....brent <eos> where is crooked hillary doing all these rallies? cannot wait for you guys over the pond to maga <eos> ...i really wish people would use the right noun here. hindi is the language. hindu is the religion. <eos> dude, it was a typo <eos> tailor is more like it. hillary panders, he tailors his message. his message is, at its core, a universal one, founded on some actual principles. hers are realpolitik/nihilist/whichever way the wind is blowing and the grass is green. <eos> wasn't it her turn?

you mean its... rare?! <eos> biased kelly is unfair and unbalanced. <eos> the high energy and genuineness, and he comes off and behaves like a leader should, instead of a conniving politician. <eos> we need a patriotic tent city our pride in america *never* sleeps <eos> "journalist" <eos> i'm not american so i can say this without being flagged, but cleaning out some us journalists putin-style wouldn't hurt. you'd be cleaning corruption. <eos> it felt so good when he teared into hillary in the first debate. "you've been fighting isis your whole life!" and something about her having accomplished nothing good in 30 years which is true. <eos> and support networks that go against the narritive, to help prop them up against cnn and it's ilk. <eos> how was the turnout? <eos> imo bernie magic worked because he was starting from dems. if he would start as green or independent he would be somewhere down there with stein <eos> i need to see that gq photo of megyn kelly farting in that chair again. <eos> jersey represent <eos> holy kek, this cut and paste animator is unbelievable <eos> ctr shills brigading the fuck out of this thread. fuck out of here cucks. <eos> ok then. just pointing out how often i see people get the simplest thing confused. its frustrating... <eos> thanks, gran'ma. <eos> both indian-americans and americans working and living in india, who vote and pay tax to the usa. https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=yesruu <eos> hahahahahaha. <eos> the msm won't tell the truth, and people are starting to see through the bullshit. that's why trust in media is at historical lows. <eos> i saw this and just shook my head. these fuckers shit on us over and over and now are surprised that we've had enough of their crap? imho it shows how tolerant we are by not resorting to violence. try fucking another group this bad and see how they react. <eos> #do not ask, just will it so, centipede <eos> literally lets go rape him, he deserves it because of his skin color you stupid racist <eos> big daddy. the temperament of a winner. <eos> i'll take my pepe extra spicy please. <eos> # what is the fall out radius of this nuke? 10 feet higher! <eos> #walls. walls never change.

you have to be mentally delusional to think *this* is the problem. <eos> i agree with the wikileaks stuff. though i think it's been a mistake to trickle the leaks out slowly. mass info dumps generally get more attention. <eos> trump listed those stats himself at this event. here's this though https://i.sli.mg/nw34cd.jpg <eos> i don't know about that but i do know that if you post a video on youtube about a video game that you got paid to make and don't say so it is illegal. there was a big thing a few years ago about a company paying people to promote their games with let's plays and didn't disclose it. a few of the bigger channels who didn't need the money exposed it. <eos> donate your money to the charity of your choosing. donate your patriotism to america. either way, trump wins. <eos> eli5 superpacs please. <eos> cnn makes rt look like mike wallace. <eos> it's the same effort as the swift boats veterans for truth. reeks of dishonesty. <eos> awesome! i wish i was there. it's great to show everyone there that there are trump supporters. <eos> **spicy** <eos> just got one on amazon for $13 pepe <eos> #bro-tier <eos> # it 15 degrees out there. we'll mail they thier coats. get em outa here <eos> her globalist puppet masters <eos> edison nj represent! <eos> that guy met hillary before and has her twitter account followed him. <eos> no. <eos> enough of this corrupt shit https://fanart.tv/fanart/movies/4929/moviethumb/hang-em-high-542974d26fed0.jpg <eos> and nate brainless lied about the numbers initially. <eos> i believe her. \#stand with mrs. obama <eos> such a beautiful man! maga <eos> for some reason the jews, chinese and indians are amazing at becoming the 1%. it's almost like some cultures are superior to others. <eos> watch her have a meltdown at the debate over this because she wants to play the victim card. <eos> my gmail is cucked https://i.sli.mg/u1g3j7.png <eos> isn't it 11pm there?

<eos> do you speak english? it's a word. <eos> this guy started uploading free shit he gets from rich people/companies. once he got a taste of the 1 percent he decided to go full sellout/promotion. <eos> here is the short story: super pacs were created for individuals to donate more then the federal maximum election donation of $2600. this was a noble idea however things have since spiraled out of control. super pacs can now skirt some election rules because they aren't controlled by the proper legislative bodies. trump has super pacs that are fairly quiet but clintons super pac organizations are completely malicious. <eos> #hello fellow millenials -h <eos> l p o o o <eos> 10 feet higher! <eos> #this wall is my wall, this wall is your wall, this wall was made for you and me.

"excuse me, mr. pew?" "it's pooooodiiieeepieeeee!!!" "i'm so sorry. is that french?" "swedish." "i love swedish culture! anyway, mr. pooooodiieeeepieeeee, we were wondering if you'd run a brief message." "i love brief messages!" "endorsing hillary clinton. we're prepared to pay you a hundred dollars. (aside to aide: what's that in swedish pretend money? about 900 kro... crow... what?) a whole kona 900." "omg i luuurv kona :d" "great, so are you in?" "you know, i'll get back to you. by the way, just so you know, my time is worth about $3,600 an hour, wew!, so i'll be sending you an invoice for this consultation. that's a whole 32,000 konas!" "uh..." <eos> less than 10% of people age 18 - 24 vote. i willing to bet that this generation will be even lower and those that watch vloggers daily will be even lower. save your red pills. <eos> philip dafuckass is a good ass guy lmao <eos> kek he's smart for not doing that <eos> only if you shart in the mart, that is. <eos> there are a lot of us who support trump he hates illegals not immigrants. fuck the media...right in the... <eos> big pizza <eos> oh my fuck i can order so much pepe stuff there. i have to refrain, though.... <eos> 0% rebellion gets nothing done, just as 100% does. we know she's a good one and will make her stands when they matter. i think she's already called out the cia for fucking up syria. that's fucking ballsy for a sitting representative. <eos> i have noticed a pattern on you tube. spend a ton of time on there, and after a bit it got fishy. good for them for making money, shame on them for having no morals about how they do it. at least a prostitute does a valuable service. <eos> how much lower can the democrats go? this is pathetic. <eos> patel motel <eos> pepe peace to india! <eos> do third parties typically endorse if they are running as well? <eos> i want to say give him her slot, but you know, i am sure he wants nothing to do with that <eos> she's campaigning hard for trump! <eos> huh...thought trump was teh big bad racist! <eos> why even sleep!? <eos> school food related systems. those companies can keep supplying cheap pizza and it counts as a vegetable serving <eos> fuck that corporate jew <eos> and then she was dead 2 months later almost to the day: jul 3rd 2014 statement was made, sept 4th 2014 she died. i'm pretty sure joan was more qualified than most to id a gay man and a trans manwoman. <eos> hey, hindusim is our religion, not what we identify ourselves by. not triggered, but we don't refer to you guy as catholics or christians. based hindu merchants would be more appropriate. cheers! <eos> the enemy of my enemy is my friend. <eos> the 3.25 generally refers to a share/percentage of all tv sets/households tuning in to that show. a few percent is actually pretty good, a very successful program will be 5+ range. something 10+ is a huge hit. <eos> would love to see a 2 hour show! hannity at 9 would be so much better! <eos> lad <eos> that's not a border, that's actually a rendered image of what the wall will look like from space :d <eos> yeah that's apache indians not bibidi indians. one is in america the other in india. <eos> he lost a fuckton of money for this... wow. he should be in politics - the kind of politician we need, not the ones we appear to be voting for. <eos> our country is in a sad state and we need an outsider to fix the mess. source: this former democrat voting for trump <eos> the next debate needs to be trump attacking the media, convincing the american people that the media is lying. <eos> should be hannipede@foxnews.com <eos> judge jeanine had some of rapin' bill's victims as guests. she is based as fuck. <eos> are those borders around that country? you're deplorable!! <eos> no one gets downvoteed for having an informed opinion brother. <eos> also, your votes don't count if you are banned, mods made sure only clinton stories make it to the top by banning around 50% of trump supporters. <eos> no, he turned it around to say her vagina was assaulting his penis. it's like beating someone's fists up with your face. <eos> think about it guys. watergate. back then there was an informant that brought everything to light. who was that informant? mark felt, associate director of the fbi. he leaked the information to the washington post. but right now, our fbi informant can't rely on the washington post. the truth seeking journalists of yesterday were replaced by corrupt slanderers of today. but there was a group of real journalists in the world. a group that risked their lives and their well being to bring even the biggest truths to the world. truths that could sway elections. truths that could bring prominent people to trial. truths that could topple governments. we don't know who our informant is, but it very well could be the fbi. there's precedent. maybe the fbi isn't all bad. maybe they had their hands tied. maybe comey had his hands tied. maybe comey is the information. we won't know until 40 years from now, i suppose. until then, informant, i thank you for your bravery. <eos> addendum: you forgot she doesn't like "needy latinos." <eos> but isn't that what's running on all the chrome books? are they discontinuing those as well? <eos> that's a nice thought. <eos> i love phil. he brightens my day every monday through thursday. <eos> is this why pewdiepie started wearing a maga hat? <eos> she should be having pepedam. <eos> indian-americans are some of the most mad of us all. have you seen their study habits? <eos> how can that be? everybody keeps saying he's a racist! <eos> im not saying they would, im saying they should <eos> and not make the endorsement or rescind the endorsement before the election? the issue is that you may begin having suicidal thoughts if you take advantage of them like that. <eos> over the wall you go! <eos> they're desperate. <eos> tipping point. liz wheeler, oan, if this sub produced a tv show. <eos> yeah. he is left leaning sometimes and he even makes fun of my state but..i find myself re subscribing because he is more fair and balanced than 85% of the channels out there. he's better than most <eos> it's more complex. they are tax free entities which i find a bit ridiculous given that they're partisan organizations. <eos> we work hard in and outside of the "paint'. we love america! <eos> top kek <eos> that site has cancer and aids. why do you think it is funny? <eos> ayyyyyy <eos> oops! i should have inherited a lot of money, lost most of it, regained it through having powerful mates, talked loads of shit in order to make thick people like me and then made my comment. you'd have supported me then! <eos> i love how she is doing the expression: statement format. <eos> middle-aged woman here. hillary is the fucking devil. yep, i said it. s, ns. <eos> the purpleman. <eos> why the fuck is she doing that? is she dying? <eos> ##where is she? it doesnt take this long to take a dump?## <eos> hindu here. this live stream guy is a asshole with the cartoons and condescending hillary picture in frame. it's ok to mock us indians, but hopefully he is not mocking trump. <eos> that would explain why hutch is super pro-hillary all of a sudden. a lot of his old tweets were bashing hillary, pro-bernie posts and he's flipped a 180. other youtube friends i've seen have said he's going way too far. <eos> > the mods aren't equipt to handle all the shills. lol the mods are the shills <eos> divorce <eos> hillary for prison resident <eos> shocking! by the way, if she's so far ahead, why pay youtubers? <eos> i just can't understand what the new york times priorities are? they focus more on whether trump moved up an armrest in first class next to a women, then hillary being responsible for the deaths of four americans. i don't care if trump farts next to a preschool when we have a women colluding with saudi officials who she most likely leaked her emails to so she could have a cushy living outside the us when the american people oust her. <eos> fucked that up lol! <eos> surprised this havent been posted yet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxiyidrdbsy <eos> offering my video editing skills <eos> we might even bait our 400 pound hacker there <eos> a very pretty boss. who could also kick my ass and has accomplished more than i ever will. <eos> nope. he's lost all credibility now. <eos> what's insane..he's travelled to three different rallys to give his speech and spread his message...and yet the msm is absolutely convinced hillary will win. fraud will be very suspect. <eos> if you looked at the cartoons, it was putin, farage, and a mexican. i don't think he was mocking indians. <eos> isn't it sad we have to give props to some loberals for not saying trumps an evil hitler racist <eos> i watched him daily just because it was 10 minutes of mindless bs. after the hillary video i'm done. <eos> not only fluent, many indian people can speak english exceptionally well. <eos> ##**based turmp** <eos> ha ha ha ha ha <eos> i've never understood "drumpff". the only people i see using that are fat pink mohawk plolygendered feminists. what is the purpose of it? <eos> yeah he had a putin gif at the bottom as well idk what his deal is. fuck that guy maga! <eos> they're combining android and chromeos in to one unified os platform that will be able to support multiple hardware platforms. apple is eventually moving towards this as well, with macos and ios gaining more integration with every update. <eos> it feels so artificial reading everything there. it's 1984 scary. not saying this sub is any better, but this sub also labeled after a candidate. where pol is labeled to promote neutral discussion. <eos> yeah, but you have to disclose that. <eos> interesting. thank you for answering my questions. <eos> can confirm. work hard, btfo every sjw, slap their kids, education, education, education, etc. <eos> i think maddow is eye candy for the lesbian crowd. <eos> i think nana is going to vote for trump <eos> like the word "the company was based in ohio" <eos> i want a word graphic of his sppeechs...largest word would be american <eos> buy a pepe! reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! <eos> im honestly ok with that. we need more advocates who are somewhat savvy with the alt right. it would be great if companies in general eventually realized that we are a successful group of people who they can make money off of. then they might not be such big pussies when sjw's make a fuss. not saying milo is great, but it's not like we're drowning in advocates who align with lots of our sub's values. who do we have besides ann coulter? <eos> how is she a misogynist? <eos> wow i love her! <eos> oh lord. <eos> i go there often and troll her page. it pumps me up more than 5 red bull's and a pack of pall malls (highly recommended) <eos> happy cake day! <eos> na pewdiepie is just a troll lol <eos> why i never! here in everything-is-equal-utopia we will never say that anyone has to change their ways. we realise that diversity is our greatest asset for a stable and just society. *(does not apply for white males or native swedes)* ^^^send ^^^help! <eos> i was campaigning with a guy today who was wearing the exact same shirt. lots of trump support here in pa. <eos> it's a shame they get confused for the evil muslims a lot. i'm sorry guys i know you're not like them it's just hard to tell <eos> i just leave the room till she not on anymore..... <eos> but i love internal combustion :( i like the idea of electric vehicles... only if everyone else is driving them <eos> the youtubers are <eos> nah we just want someone who cares about america not power <eos> this was aftermath to a bigger one last week. on that thread everyone that wanted in commented and they were all messaged yesterday about this. if you want i can message you for the next one if happens! <eos> why don't we like megyn? <eos> fox business rocks.... <eos> she doesn't write her scripts does she? don't these people just read what they're given and have some little "personality" created for them in a back room somewhere? <eos> phaggot <eos> it's like when people go after hannity, he labels his show as republican so being biased is fine. when you call yourself neutral and are more biased than anything else is where you run into the problem. <eos> it's actually 5 million subscribers. not that it refutes your point or anything. <eos> putting that saudi oil money to good use it looks like. it is pathetic how much she has to pay people just to have perceived support. trump doesn't have to do any of this because speaks to american people and not hide behind a teleprompter. <eos> i'm in my early 20s, so i should be into these people i guess, but i find them so unbearable. anyone who starts to geting famous on yt becomes unbearable to me, like ethan klein. they're so cringe worthy and i cannot understand the appeal. it's something about yt. <eos> i think those cultures just have a better work ethic than americans do. i know sometimes in the it field in india, it's common to work 16 hour days <eos> well, we don't actually call them "hindu guys".. we call them by name.. <eos> when all of this is said and done reporters like him who spoke the truth will be the only ones left standing <eos> why? do people get paid for this? i can't think of anything less interesting then self reporting my viewing habits for a week. <eos> it will have a wall too <eos> i saw hillary pop up when he mentioned trade deficit plus that mexican is apu from simpson a caricature of indians in america working in corner stores having dozens of babies etc. <eos> the thing that pisses me off about his channel is his blatant clickbait sexual thumbnails. <eos> idk they're not paid to moderate. i honestly think it goes above them to the reddit admins. <eos> and here i was expecting some limoncello. <eos> that's why we're here <eos> at least sean is upfront about his bias. megyn pretends to be a serious journalist... seems to be in vogue nowadays. <eos> for the bears.. alaskan bears are the spawn of satan.... <eos> america great disaster china really believe important rigged love <eos> lets be honest, most popular youtubers arent voting for trump, but we still like them. <eos> 10 feet higher <eos> #with a small loan of a million bricks...

studies do you? lol <eos> please type "1" if you're being raped right this very moment. <eos> our state is going maga this year <eos> you're right. been one since 1700s http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ain't <eos> at one point he started doing that in combination with the stupid video titles like all caps ending in question mark? and it was a shame because i liked his stuff before. oh well. he's proven himself to not be a complete retard shill like so many others. <eos> the original account owners sold their accounts to ctr folks so they could take over the sub. <eos> do you remember the mccarthy house unamerican activities witch hunts? actors suffered horribly from them. i can see some establishment congress critter starting them up again, if things go very wrong. we already have the based conservatives and progressives equal commie sympathizers thing going on. <eos> of course..hollywood is just another extension of democratic control of the people. part of any full societal control involves propping up entertainers and having them help sway the populace in exchange for an easier life. they were just ...well...people who are streamers like pewdiepie are going to laugh at any offer and anyoone else wwill seem well..fake right? sorry youtube celebs...you're cool but no one is looking for your political opinion unless you post a vid. <eos> just messing around. most indians are based. <eos> you mean like mods of a certain subreddit that can't be named? <eos> this video basically summarizes it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbijqtbcquw casey's videos are basically a prefect eye-candy blend of extremely professional "unprofessional" video. his videos have a very high production-quality while still seeming natural. <eos> is it illegal to pay someone to endorse you? i thought it was just illegal to "buy" votes. <eos> yep. search the wikileaks for jeffrey katzenberg, rob reiner etc. <eos> i've watched this guy since grade school and he has not changed one bit. much respect for he and his wife's internet success, they seem like very genuine people. <eos> not surprised after they posted fake ads on craigslist trying to fool people into thinking it was trump looking for hot employees <eos> pepe bot left. *feelsbadman* <eos> michael clinton? <eos> iove when trump supporters have nothing to do but make fun of the current presidents wife you guys are fucked <eos> so just fox news as of a week ago? <eos> -calls out radical islam -badass, masculine -family oriented -business oriented -lower taxes -tired of corrupt politicans <eos> no dude he's nowhere near broke <eos> pepe din du nuffin! <eos> do the rest of us have integrity? given the authoritarian socialist climate in nyc of late... it's hardly surprise. potential counter offensive digging the nyt archives for journalistic doozies... the more farfetched, tabloid material the better... they should be legit nyt, tho. ease up on the anger and laugh it off. hard-hitters would be undermining ethics of the nyt with legit ethical concerns either related to this election, the leaks or just in general. but remember unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and faked info just make you look like 'tards social butterflies or gossip queens could travel across the political divide by ignoring the trump (don't draw parallels) but hitting the ethical concerns when it comes to other celebs... the best for riling up the international fanboys and girls is sleaze news on dead celebrities. failing that just general drama, there's the socialite scene, the broadway & off off off, and all local (three states wide) scenes... most will remain or publicly be hrc, but its diminishing the credibility of nyt and media in general - approach from a leftists perspective unless the crowd just wants to keep jerking themselves off... you're looking to damage their investment not promote your own. there's enough self congratulating media out there to fap to. <eos> landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory

eventually they will become primarily an email hosting and news feed conglomerate similar to yahoo. i switched to bing not too long ago and can say it's better in almost every aspect so far in terms of functionality. search results are "roughly" the same, and i really haven't missed google at all. next up will be switching back to firefox. <eos> it's amusing that you think reddit is in any way significant in who people vote for. <eos> maybe with all the backlash he's going to get from liberals he might just vote trump! <eos> thats just fucking desprate <eos> i do not see any hindus all i see is a particularly rare pepe <eos> sad! <eos> u r a sexist hurr durr vote for hillary or u r dum <eos> i love her! daddy, can we keep her, pleeeeeeeease?? <eos> that's what he does. <eos> and that is why microsoft will eventually win. apple and google are putting a mobile os on a laptop, but msft is putting its desktop into tablets (hopefully phones soon) <eos> i mean...msm treats trump as a nazi but any half-brained nitwit can tell trump has great intentions both for americans and the "global community". he's not trying to start ww3 with russia and he just saidd to a bunch of indian-americans that he wants to make india and america democratic best friends. waaayyy different direction and ignoring that is just plugging your ears and screaming i cant hear you. <eos> [**hey, that's pretty good.**](https://youtu.be/el7s751atb4) <eos> i'd rather the first result be the fleetwood mac song. <eos> she would have pulled a lot of independents over, that's for sure. but pence spanked the fuck out of kaine, so idk. <eos> she will absolutely siphon votes from crooked hillary. hillary's catch 22 is, she ignores her and jill keeps taking some of her supporters by being the based twitter grandma. she acknowledges her and dismisses her, she calls attention to her and opens up the door for even more siphoning. jill is the chaotic good candidate in this election (trump is lawful good, crooked is of course just evil) <eos> fuck that, he's crossed the planck scale! <eos> exactly. if it was called the_clinton it would be fine. but it's labeled politics. it's misleading and completely discredits the sub as a whole. i actually want levelheaded discussion on the issues and all i seem to get are akin to tmz articles with both sides calling eachother out with buzzwords. pathetic journalism when there are facts in these wikileaks that the public really needs to be informed about. <eos> yes please do! <eos> oh no that's not annoying or anything <eos> 2 whole hours of hannipede! #*hhhhhhnnnnnnnggggg* <eos> more like, "oh-bummer", ammirite?? <eos> putin and russians beef is with this administration and hillary. not america or americans. <eos> obviously the riddler because he tips his opponents off before he does anything. <eos> that would explain the rambling speeches and nonanswers at the debates! <eos> isn't that illegal? or against reddits rules? <eos> she would find a way to fuck over other prisoners and take all of their commissary money. <eos> it's commonly referred to lovingly in the indian community as the "patel motel cartel" <eos> this election

wikileaks discovery threads do not get cluttered. the bots are great, and i think once we win we can bring them back. <eos> that'll tank <eos> i think the government passed out "please don't rape me" bracelets, so everything is fine. <eos> what they were saying on the radio today is: it is russia, and donald trump is just reading off whatever russia gives to wikileaks, and they could well be fabricating, but trump is being dangerous and grasping whatever he's given. <eos> he's right. so the big question is - what is he going to do about it? just sit there and get owned? <eos> she doesnt seem to "hate" trump very much at all. i hope she comes with us on the wild ride!!! <eos> so say we all. <eos> >ebt kek <eos> only two genders <eos> he has met hillary before, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgb-85otfrw <eos> 111!1!!!111!!!! <eos> agreed. lol <eos> #hillaryfortpp <eos> #what are you talking about he literally raped them you are a racist!@!#!@# <eos> we want trump! <eos> i don't know about the simpsons inage, but i do know that samosas are delicious and they just made me yearn... <eos> you sweet summer child <eos> i wouldn't be surprised if pewdiepie pulled that. he's been known to do some masterful trolling recently. <eos> so your second would have been to hire a team to flood the comments sections with fake accounts expressing approval of the message and massaging the votes to make your popular support look greater than it actually is, right? hm... sounds like a plan, you should call that operation commenting the record or something catchy like that. <eos> dear god i feel terrible for the swedes and germans. just establish civil war already. <eos> a beautiful american family! <eos> the russian angle is actually one of the more compelling issues to use when defending trumpism to typical hillary supporters. there's no reason whatsoever to be adversaries with the russians, considering they're anti-globalist, nationalistic, and trying to keep their islamist issue under control. <eos> have you noticed that these women are saying they came forward because during the second debate he said, "no, i have not," to a question by cooper?? what are the chances that all of these women had these experiences, never came forward, end up all watching the second debate (which had far fewer viewers than the first), and have the exact same reaction to his words?? compelling them to step forward - because the *truth must be known*? i don't want to insult these women by calling them liars, but not one of them has a a reasonable story. and what about the ones that are just, "i thought it was a camera bag from the photographer that touched my backside, but then i turned around and saw trump" (which she didn't confirm it *was* him and either way, it's a non-story) or the others where they say, "he kissed me on the lips!" i guess we should be grateful they're not claiming he raped them. i wouldn't put it past the clinton cartel to arrange that. a law enforcement officials in our thread have said that lying they were raped is a serious offense, but these women are likely to get away with saying all of this. the timing is offensive to me. it's days from election day. it's politically calculated. it makes me sick. if any of these women were that concerned, they would have said something months ago or at the time. i would love to see their financial records to look for payments for their "confessions", phone history, and digital history to see the origination of their claims. the most annoying thing that i read today was that the pageant contestants said, "he made us parade around in front of him," and "he walked backstage with melania while we were getting dressed." ummm.. you're in a fucking beauty contest. no different than a modeling agency. the man who owns the place is applying his personal taste to assess the candidates and give suggestions. and going with my analogy...models have to get naked on-set all of the time around photographers, people on set, etc. - it's part of the business. if you don't want to be objectified, don't enter a beauty pageant, you fucking idiots. the same thing applies to men in modeling. there are gay casting directors, photographers, and stylists (people that measure inseams and fit clothes) who have a history of touching male models "inappropriately", making lewd comments, and objectifying the men. there are articles about it. google it. it happens on both sides. here's the deal: by modeling, you are saying, "look at me. i am the perfect example of what it means to be a human. i'm a model human." get out of that line of work if you don't like it. and since crooked hillary is paying youtube stars for endorsements and to make advertising videos, makes fake craigslist ads against him to show he's a predator, a tape gets released right after the first john podesta emails leak, the accusations come right after he wins the second debate (second debates have historically been considered a huge factor in who wins the presidency), and the stories come out all at once...i'm not buying it. i'm sorry. again...even if it is true, i think it's outrageous to wait days before an election to say something. it's an insult to our democracy, an insult to voters that have invested time and money supporting candidates, and insulting to all politicians that have had to deal with these two candidates. we only have two choices. to attempt to influence an election (again, days before the final votes) is so outrageous. so at this point, i have zero sympathy to any of the women's day and they have zero credibility. fantastical scenario: the week of the election, 50 people come forward and say that hillary clinton raped them anally with a strap-on and bill jerked off in the corner. do people change their vote? that's what this is. it's not fair to anyone. <eos> her opening statement today was fantastic. <eos> the old crone has knowingly acted above the law and has no regard for the people. if you don't want justice then you aren't american <eos> it's just something they tell themselves, most of them. they don't actually try to be like anyone, they just try to be like their own interpretation of what they think he embodies. it's the ones that do literally try to be like him that you've got to worry about, and those motherfuckers seem to be on the rise these days <eos> nah, more like two-face imo, the coin flip decides if you live or die <eos> ah i didn't notice it was apu. i wasn't looking too hard since he was wearing a sombrero. i think the guy was being tongue in cheek. <eos> her campaign is so fucking filthy. just incredible. <eos> yep. these folks have no idea how close they are to some seriously bad things happening. this is slander against all of us for expressing our rights. fuck those cucks.. <eos> to be honest rosa parks was a member of a radical communist organization and she was paid by them to start a scene on that bus. the same people as the globalists now controlling things, or more accurately, their fathers. ali was ok though. <eos> deadpool is *definitely* crazy based plant lady. <eos> she's throwing vases at bill and screaming curses at the donald. maybe she will pop a clot....one may only pray. <eos> let's just be glad that r/politics had stayed neutral. <eos> most of these major youtubers are making a business out of their stream. i would think it qualifies. <eos> does he still cut all the breaths out of his videos? <eos> let's find their channels and call them out. <eos> he did? <eos> #my nigga! <eos> i wish trump would ask her at the debate, "i see your campaign schedule for the month of october is totally empty. are you dying or are you just lazy?" <eos> you can literally go [here](https://www.willhillarywin.com/hillary-clintons-events/) and choose to only show (c)linton. the only thing listed is the debate and election day on nov 8th and electoral college vote on dec 19th (which doesn't make any sense). but her poor health is just a conspiracy theory. <eos> that's what she does. she gets cracked out on all kinds of drugs for the debates so she doesn't croak on stage, and then needs 3 weeks off. this is insane. could you imagine if this was trump avoiding all these events? it would be front page news for 48 hours straight making up all kinds of speculation. they need to hide hillary, because the more she makes appearances the less people like her. <eos> [also this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaxxnvlmtdc) <eos> going by the picture, based pepefest 2016. <eos> #pepe chaheyay <eos> if gobbles was alive he's shed tears of joy seeing how far propoganda has come <eos> if he cared about america he's be trying to to introduce a system where people can afford to go the hospital and where people can go to school without the fear of being shot. but of course someone like that is anti-american. you guys defy belief. <eos> is milo the guy that looks like a younger anderson cooper? <eos> parks looks uncomfortable and trump seems excessively proud of himself... you get a medal for social work? people should just do it, blind charity and whatnot. <eos> mobile strike is basically our foreign policy on syria at this point. <eos> #this this this. it ain't rocket science! <eos> impressive #length <eos> i actually like calling *them* r/[redacted]. it's like they're not worth our time to be called by name. worthless cucks. <eos> give him a drug test! <eos> we have a similar situation like people in america. we want to work and make our country better. but some groups always are inclined towards rioting. media is constantly bashing majority hindu. people make fun of hindu gods but if hindus make fun of any other , instant jail. media bashing on right-wing all the time a pandering to so called minority groups. even minority want to have a better life but they are misled by politicians and media to always ask for more and bash the majority groups. current pm is a staunch nationalist but had to go through a similar media trial since 2002. currently if any minority can kill my family and do heinous stuff and media will cover it like a normal case. but if i say one bad thing to a minority it will become a huge issue in media. these things were the only thing previous super corrupt govt was looking at and no development was happening. current pm was brought in even with all media and ngo groups like ford foundation , clinton foundation against him. indians have taken their red pill. hopefully the globalist onslaught is stopped and nations work together for better world rather than power lobbies like soros , clinton bush etc using subvert efforts to destroy other nations to benefit their own. <eos> yep, i don't agree with dick he has to say about politics but his videos are enjoying as fuck to watch. <eos> how much? is selling out your soul worth!? <eos> in alaska? by a polar bear? <eos> truth hurts. what an ogre of a human. nasty piece of work. has the worst trash on the planet to her parties,but her poor girls showing their asses and smoking dope are offended by trump. go fuck yourself. <eos> we suspect your

they give direction, yes they have bosses but they have a wide range <eos> that's why she's on her fifth husband <eos> 3.1 meters, cucks! <eos> oh my god! look at that family of racists! rrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeee!!! <eos> the '84 debate is where reagan said "i will not make fun of my opponent's youth and inexperience" right? <eos> would have been great if he had come out in support of trump just because of the offer. but this is good enough. <eos> > casey nistate what a shill. <eos> i still don't get his appeal though...he's literally just a vlogger that occasionally does little pranks or messes around with people(from my experience). <eos> big 'roni <eos> with what? pitchforks and mean thoughts? no guns here. hell, even pepperspray is illegal. keep in mind also that most are brainwashed cucks that think everything is fine. some think we aren't doing enough! <eos> #1f 1f 1f 1f 1f 1f 1f ok1e doke <eos> brave and fearless. all my respect. <eos> you mean /r/voldemort? <eos> yeah i watched him almost everyday, since that video i un subbed and i don't watch his videos anymore, nor will i again. i don't have a problem with him supporting hillary, but the fact he spewed all that bullshit anti trump shit, and sounded just like the main stream media i lost any bit of respect i had for him. <eos> i've seen more and more leftist folks claiming just how dangerous trump is right now. why all of the sudden are they so worried, i thought the polls don't lie? <eos> > one is an entire article blaming russians (of course). or, you know, they could actually review the contents of the leaks instead of manufacturing baseless accusations about who provided the information for the public discourse. hell, why does it even matter who caused the leaks? for all we know, the podesta emails were released to wikileaks by john podesta himself, but they would never consider such a talking point. remember: if you go through your significant other's phone and find that they've been cheating on you, you're at fault for checking their phone rather than them being at fault for cheating! <eos> that's his whole message recently <eos> i had so much fun i definitely plan on doing it again soon. <eos> burn it down. <eos> shocker. <eos> > we have never used offensive cyber just off the top of my head, wasn't stuxnet a joint us/israeli offensive cyber attack on iranian

<eos> is there video of this speech? <eos> hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha that is awesome <eos> i'm not convinced tho. the adam's apple thing is flimsy in my opinion. some women produce more testosterone so have more "masculine" secondary sex characteristics. conversely, some men produce female hormones and get gynecomastia (not just moobs, but actual breast tissue) and have nonprominent thyroid cartilages. also the men don't have to be fat to get gynecomastia. interesting meme origin though. <eos> good bye megyn... you are a soulless angry little troll... <eos> yep. i usually watch o'reilly and hannity, but skip dopey megyn. she's too biased against trump, has been from the beginning. i can't watch her bleed out of her eyes and her...wherever anymore. <eos> he's super silent about it because he is retired and hasn't been on the air for nearly two years. he's been living in a remote cabin in the woods with jon stewart. <eos> leafy would never get paid by clinton. none of

curious. can someone please tell me a good reason to vote trump? ive seen bad things from both sides and i really just want to skip this election. so i want to know what really redeems trump? <eos>

lol <eos> we need a hannipede network. 25 hours a day of hannipede. <eos> same with canada. we've got some of the best reactor technology in the world and boatloads of uranium. yet, the ontario government has spent countless billions on their failed renewable energy plan. in the span of 15 years, we went from having some of the cheapest electricity rates in north america to the highest. it's becoming a huge scandal. our premier (like a governor) is cut from the same cloth as hillary. there's also new thorium reactor technology coming out which promises to be even safer and cleaner than uranium. more energy per ton of fuel, less radioactive waste, can't be weaponized, significantly less meltdown risk, more abundant fuel source than uranium. and the best part? existing heavy water reactors (ie. canada's candu reactors) can already accept thorium fuel. <eos> lol way to spin a good thing. fuck head <eos> as a hindu sure we do. we have seen the barbarity of islam for a 1000 years and sacrificed countless lives defending our civilization. but being in us we also care about our work permits which trump and his nativist supporters want to rescind. as some other guy said, we are unabashed capitalists and we support who benefits us. it doesnt matter in the slightest if its trump or hillary. <eos> i lub you. <eos> big time respect in a completely corrupted platform, country, nation that forgot what moral compass means. a renaissance of american patriotism is needed and marching. join in. <eos> mattv2099 probably is. <eos> during the primaries it was all trump and sanders. now it's only clinton. doesn't make sense. <eos> have any idea of funhaus?

silver hair, that anti-clinton. too much....48 inch maga boner <eos> what are they going to smoke a hookah on stage? <eos> man, i tried to bring up this point yesterday over at srd where i saw a thread of people bashing t_d over the whole r/redacted bullshit that is being forced upon everyone here. they were going on and on about how this sub is a bunch of hypocrites for expecting free speech when they don't practice it. i mean come the fuck on, this place doesn't claim to be bipartisan at all, but that place that i can't even mention totally does. who are the actual hypocrites here? <eos> fuckin love jill <eos> while shills are shilling against her over in redacted <eos> no their main attack right now is on the drug testing coverage and the 9th fake accusation. total biased bullshit. <eos> thats my homeboy! based indian bro <eos> i'm sorry that you were assaulted in such a disgusting and heinous way. seriously - that fucker who did that deserves to burn in hell. it mortally pisses me the fuck off that sjw-fucks take the phrases 'sexual assault' or 'assault' and, then because they are so fucking feeble-minded and weak - that they use any perceived slight against them, and blow it up into something akin to soul-crushing incidents. or they fake accusations and destroy people around them, and think they are oh-so-fucking-self-righteous for it. these fucks have no fucking idea. to any rational human being, all victims of sexual assault, both male and female, have a voice. its only those spineless pricks that claim that men don't. <eos> i took love and i took it down! climb a mountain, then i turned around. <eos> looks like morning joe is turning into a butch lesbian <eos> if they put hannapede on at 9pm he would rock that world. he used to be on at 9pm with the ass wipe alan colmes <eos> can someone post the actual link to the actual email from wikileaks? <eos> you mean r/[redacted]? <eos> journalism is dead <eos> our government is dead. no trump, no dice. also, it will take a generation just to sort through all this corruption with the leaks. busy little bastards they've been. <eos> honestly this will be going down in history, propoganda has never been forced onto the mass population like this before <eos> *except* in china or n korea but never here <eos> i hope it goes down in history. if they win, it very well could be swept under the rug some more. <eos> history is written by the victor <eos> there is no recovery from this corruption. unless revolution. voting hardly worked before, but since they can rig the machines there has been no hope. <eos> they want to demoralize you. don't let them. <eos> if civil war breaks out i'll need a place to stay...ct is no friend to me <eos> i'm holding up costco. we have to hold up cabelas first though..... <eos> i love you <eos> well have to take out some big ass mofos at cabelas but, stacking ammunition on the downward escalators will be all worth it. 😊 <eos> secession never looked better. come and take it. <eos> you're already seeing it, people are turning off cnn and heading to alternative sources. a good number of millenials to generation x are done with msm. <eos> at the same time we were cutting cords anyway. what timing. <eos> they still watch john oliver, amanda bee, snl, etc. <eos> > john oliver, amanda bee, snl professional political charlatans <eos> a brit, a canadian, and a south african all doing terrible comedy routines to criticize the us. if my eyes rolled any harder they would fall out <eos> literal cancer tier journalism. <eos> it's supposed to be entertainment, but dumb college kids started treating it like the journalism. most of it was satire. now it's propaganda. <eos> even social media is starting to be censored. our stuff keeps getting taken down from the front page. we would soon need to find other avenues besides the increasingly cucking facebook and reddit. <eos> the war with russia is to cover up the leaks. cnn are now linking wikileaks on twitter with 'apparent' hacked emails. clinton has even said collusion between trump and russia. they have zero evidence on russia hacking the emails. they didn't not have any sort of a committee prior to announcing war with russia . <eos> like the mighty centipede, america must go through a molt to shed it's shell and grow stronger. <eos> wow. we are going to have a french revolution. <eos> with how much bloodshed there was, i sincerely hope it doesn't come to that. <eos> remember kids, in france they had to invent a mechanized way to decapitate people since they were doing so much of it. you're probably talking about 20-40k beheaded. all the elites and their families. can you imagine the fear that the ruling class felt? <eos> do you know what's telling? not a single independent mind in the msm except for a few at fox willing to take a stand, their careers mean more to them than the future of western civilization! <eos> that's if we stop it right now. <eos> i certainly have lost all the remaining faith i had in "journalism". <eos> #we are the generation to rebuild it! we are up to the challenge! <eos> #generation trump <eos> start your own blogs and news! make it happen today!@!@ <eos> well, i mean... that's optimistic. as a great man once said: #"print is dead" *- dr. egon spengler* <eos> who the fuck is egon? -director of ghostbusters 3 <eos> people we are going to see a new network rise after the election! <eos> i cancelled cable about a year ago but before i did there was a station called one america news. they seemed legit - all reporting without the bias. <eos> that was a legit station. one of the lady reporters was freaking based. oh my <eos> subversion is real. <eos> i think it'll fully be gone tbh. <eos> this guy gets it. that will be key for our businesses to thrive and to take a bigger share of the money so they can invest it in there business by hiring employees, etc. we need as little barriers as possible in business. <eos> i hope he talked about selfless service. will resonate with hindus, and that's what this campaign is for him. <eos> they can call me for comment. i have a few comments saved up <eos>

just because of the propaganda and because nobody has reached out to us yet. no they vote democratic because the democrats dont call us satanists or devil worshippers or fund evangelist groups that are actively seeking to destroy the rich religion back in india. they also lean democrat because they dont have nativist "they took our jobs" rhetoric. indian-americans (predominantly hindus) would vote republican if the republicans would be sensitive to these above issues. but no they arent and frankly i dont even care. their country, their rules. i dont need somebody pandering to us because as a community we are sufficient enough to take care of ourselves. but that doesnt mean the india-american community democrat is all purely out of propaganda. >im sure hillary would continue that retardation. hillary wants to staple green cards to indian-american students when the graduate from their masters while donald wants to take away our job opportunities. again, i repeat he is probably justified because he wants to americans or whatever but still the indian americans will support who acts in their self interest. you get the idea ? <eos> >*kill me* -bernouts <eos> i love america's hindus. i used to tutor an indian family's kid back home. dad was a high educated software dude, and mom was wither a m.s. or phd scientist. kids were smart af. they work hard and don't make excuses for themselves. i am happy to see so many supporting trump <eos> i can't largely disagree. putin is undenably an evil dictator, but he has many positive qualities. nor do i have any concern that trump will underestimate putin; he surrounds himself with good advisors, and at the end of the day, let's face it: they're both alpha male types. the difference being that trump actually is an alpha male, whereas putin just plays one. so they'll understand each other very well, but if push comes to shove, trump can and will cream him. <eos> how did it go there? <eos> landslide victory landslide victory

i understand she prefers him over hillary, but personally i don't think a third party would endorse and outright say just vote for trump. i don't have any memory of that happening in previous elections, but this one is full of firsts. <eos> i dont think he is evil. ive studdied russian geopolitics for a few months. its just that russia is special, it needs a strong, scary, leader. if it doesnt, it will fall apart. ever since its union, russia is balancing on a silk thread, the slightest hickup and it will fall apart and split into more than 5 nations. thats why they need almost dictator-like people like putin. its a necessary evil for the greater good of the country. <eos> the graphics on this screen lmaaaao. clapping putin, abu from the simpsons. lmaaaao. dying <eos> i

people here and there support hillary. <eos> i plan to pokemon go to the polls and voting for trump. <eos> your revolution is over, centipedes! condolences! the centipedes lost! my advice is, do what

nice change of pace, having like 10 personalities taking turns at the slot with different approaches and takes on the issues. <eos> it's the battle of the butch haircuts! <eos> replace megyn with a robot reading wikileaks emails and you'll get higher ratings. <eos> thinking about it rationally, this may be likely, she has however a lot of worth in continuing her campaign for her voters would for the most part vote for hillary otherwise, and i'd wager that any sane and honest man on earth wouldn't want hillary to have more votes or let alone win the presidency. <eos> because pretending theres no problem makes the problem go away, right? inst that how they beat voldemort? <eos> the best thing about facebook is they can't "down vote" a post and make it hidden. once the post is made (unless

up with it. they'll actually have to function in the real world and not be the selfish, entitled, pansy-arses that they are. <eos> let's start with hillary: she is, without a doubt, the single most corrupt person to run for office. the wikileaks are just some of the missing pieces to put the jigsaw puzzle together. crooked hillary stole the nomination because she knows she can't win a presidential primary fairly (see 2008 with obama). stealing the nomination: • trying to move primary dates to favor clinton • threatening sanders supporters in government. anybody who endorsed sanders was cut off from fundraising from big donors, which is part of the reason she had 90% support from government officials. • this ties into the bullet directly above: most of those individuals who many have supported sanders and were forced to endorse clinton for fear of retribution (or various other reasons like repayment of political favors, promise of funding and/government appointments, etc.), also most of the time were *superdelegates*. this rigs the game even further. 90% of the superdelegates signed on even before sanders entered the race. this led to a gigantic lead so whenever the media reported the numbers, they reported the combined numbers of pledged delegates and superdelegates, giving the impression that hillary always had a solid lead. this does have an impact on voter turnout. • refusing to do the final debate she had agreed upon • changing the debate dates and times for minimal exposure • ridiculous hits against him like trying to attack his religion (see dnc leaks) • dnc staff not supportive of sanders (see leaks) • getting the debate questions ahead of time • coordinating with the previous chair of the dnc, debbie wasserman-shulz, even though she's supposed to be impartial to the campaigns. then, when words get out, debbie steps down and is hired by clinton on her campaign. sickening. • coordinating with the current chair of the dnc, donna brazile (see wikileaks). • taking tens of millions of dollars of wall street which created an early advantage in funding her operation • secret meetings with the media. being given veto power over articles. planting stories and requesting hitjob articles against political opponents. • due to this favorable relationship with the media (these media companies giving money to her foundation and her campaign), she received a much higher amount of media coverage, increasing the recognition and support she already had, while bernie had to remind people he's still running. he had to fight for five minute segments. they would drool over the chance to keep hillary as long as they could. • scripted call-in segments. bernie had to go into shows physically or via satellite. they allowed hillary to use the phone and literally recite talking points from scripts. see the leaks. it's also on youtube. call into chris hayes show while repeating script. now, she's trying to steal the general election for the presidency? crooked has done so much to smear donald. the fake craigslist ads trying to pin him as a predator (see wikileaks), the collusion with the media, rigging the polls (her super pac pays for polls that manipulate the outcome to favor her, wsj and others use the data. also, influencing when polls are taken to get the worst possible result for trump, rather than using a consistent methodology), releasing that stupid tape, her "pied piper" strategy, and i could keep going. campaign finance law violations, her handling of classified information, her shady foundation, and all of that. i'm not even getting into that. let's stick to the campaign. she's said she has a private and a public position on policies. you can't trust anything she says. she's pro-tpp. she's against legalization of marijuana. she and her husband are personally against gay marriage (this speaks to her heart, or lack thereof); she was against gay marriage as a senator, changed her policy position, but still personally opposes it. she will say *anything* to get elected. the leaks show that everything she does is poll-tested and fabricated by her team. she has no core. if she hasn't been coached on a policy, she will dodge the issue and say she'll have to get back to you. she can't share her initial thoughts/opinions about subjects. she's a slimy former attorney who can memorize tons of scripted dialogue, but she uses "i don't recall" hundreds of time when she's being investigated. every word, every phrase, every statement - is politically calculated. review the leaks. they even tried mulled over whether to say "turned over" vs "handed over" for her emails - they wanted to make it sound more cooperative vs being forced. now...for trump? he will share his thoughts about any subject so you know what his core is or how he thinks about things. he is the first political candidate to do post-debate interviews; after the first debate, he walked over to the press spin room and answered questions, while hillary left the venue. he calls into tons of shows, does hundreds of rallies (hillary does like a quarter of the number, probably not even that many), does tons of interviews and press conferences (hillary didn't do a press conference for almost 300 days, and then when she did, she dodged questions and ended it quickly), and i could keep going about the positive qualities. let's get to policy. trump policy trade agreements are my biggest issue. nafta (north american free trade agreement) opened up our borders to businesses within north america. companies could move factories to mexico to create jobs, and for cheaper labor than in the us. sounds great, right? but it put millions of people in mexico and the us out of work. low skill labor jobs like factory work moved to mexico, while skilled labor jobs being done in mexico were eliminated by the us. open borders for big corporate, but closed borders for people. millions of farmers in mexico were put out of work because of how much our government subsidizes farmers in the us. our government pays farmers to not grow crops, that's how much corn we produce. so selling our crops for dirt cheap in mexico put so many people out of work. after nafta, illegal immigration skyrocketed. in order for mexicans to make a living wage, they had to come to america illegally. now look at the tpp (trans-pacific partnership), it's looking to do the same exact thing with asian countries. big corporate will move their factories to third world countries with lax labor laws, decrease their spending, while you still spend $700 on your iphone 8. the only people who win from these trade agreements are the already filthy rich. we'll still pay the same exact price for goods, while they increase their profit margins. americans lose out because their jobs are being shipped overseas, and third world countries lose out because their people are being exploited. and you think it's just low level factory work that's going to be outsourced? hillary wants a massive increase of the h1b1 visas, where major tech companies can hire immigrants at a fraction of the price of americans. oh yeah, you'll be hearing "they took 'er jobs!" from people with software engineering and computer science degrees, not just rednecks. on top of that, he's one of the most socially liberal republican nominees in decades. on social issues like gay marriage, he doesn't give a fuck. transsexuals using the bathroom they desire? let them use the damn restroom! everything the media paints him out to be, you can heavily research and find out that they skipped context and they're wrong. <eos> talking about overstating the obvious. most of her tweets are like this. not impressed with her. <eos> done. lower taxes bring corporate tax in line with other nations reduce illegal aliens so americans have a better shot at employment <eos> sleep? what's sleep??? **high energy

couple hundred of years. <eos> can confirm. am patel from a motel. this is how we roll. <eos> shout out to that based hindu centipede in my hometown of edison, nj!!!! <eos> that must be one of those hindu red necks i heard so much about. <eos> "her" proportions are more manly than 50% of adult guys. look into it <eos> ok, i really have no idea how it works. i'm extremely cynical i guess. i assume fox or whoever would want total control over their brand. that's interesting, thanks <eos> i'm watching live satellite news, you guys! <eos> no different than that jewish candlestick, right? all religion is kind of weird if you take an objective view. <eos> you forgot the option for "**no more fucking bots**" <eos> yessir it is! <eos> mine too! based edison hindu centipede! <eos> beautiful outfit. <eos> we have the best nuclear families. <eos> i'd buy that man a beer; he deserves it. <eos> we are being brigaded folks. 10 feet taller! out out out <eos> no no- this is a journalist who said his strategy was to not be shit to bernie, so that later he could look vaguely legitimate when he switched to shilling for hillary. <eos> she shouldn't even know what a coat is! coats forever and always!!!! <eos> tulsi means holy basil, a hindu word for our most reverred plant. it signifies purity even if growing in the shit called democrats. <eos> **her name is tulsi gabbard** and i want her in the us government. <eos> great energy and trump nailed it on radical terrorism and increasing relations with india. what indian hates most is terrorism, if donald trump touches the chord with indians on terrorism they are going to get behind him. no amount of propaganda will change their mind - they are hard headed that way. also fuck op using the stupid cartoonist video. this is better https://youtu.be/xzypk2bgmpy <eos> this thread is proof that people will just spam the shit out of the bots, be it nefarious or otherwise. **if** (if if if if okie doke!) you decide to bring some of the bots back, there needs to be a hard coded limit on how many times you can spam them in a single thread. and absolutely no bot spam in 'serious' threads. spam just detracts from our goal, and just gives shills another weapon to try and divide us. i liked the coat bot, personally. but i personally think that the bots have outlived their usefulness. <eos> i like the no bots better but its not my place to say <eos> i have many hindu friends that are voting trump. <eos> can't wait till the god emperor wins and puts these media cucks in their place <eos> i wish somebody like tim russert would pop up. hard hitting questions for everybody. no bullshit. <eos> as much as i love the wall bot, we must not clutter our threads with bot responses during this critical time in the election year, so i say: #no bots! <eos> maga hat, pepe shirt, blanket! true patriot!🇺🇸 <eos> indian american here. 24 years old and voting trump. so are 99% of my family/extended family <eos> i was wondering what happened to the bots here, they were highly entertaining. especially the buy pepe one. <eos> i'm expecting a disgruntled reporter to go rogue and spill the beans on live tv <eos> only one was his ex-wife during the divorce, but she denied it this year as well and he was the best man at her second wedding, so i'm guessing she was just angry <eos> this whole thing is so obviously fabricated. a few weeks ago we had cucked media harping on about how young women don't care about hillary and trying to figure out why. the campaign probably took note of this and discovered that the trendiest thing with young women these days is rape & sexual assault, and pretending to have been raped. so they concocted this bullshit as a way to moralize millennial feminists, who probably would have sat out this election or voted 3rd party, to vote for hillary. <eos> also that loopy harth with all the dodgy emails asking for a job. <eos> she said the *rape* was not in the literal, but in more of a symbolic sense. >“as a woman, i felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent. i referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but i do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.” <eos> how about not using the word rape then? <eos> what about this? http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/exclusive-inside-the-donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuit/ i wanted to make sure i was correct when i say he never had a sexual assault charge before running against hillary clinton, so i did a quick google search. <eos> > this was around the same time that trump was active in the beauty pageant world. harth’s lawsuit came as her former husband george houraney was involved in a breach-of-contract dispute with trump over a beauty contest at one of trump’s properties in atlantic city, new jersey. <eos> also, > the court record indicates it was “voluntarily dismissed” but “without prejudice,” meaning she could have re-filed the case. the timing is interesting because at around the same time the case was withdrawn, trump reportedly agreed to settle with her husband’s company and finally: > harth, who now runs a beauty business, says she’s put the lawsuit behind her, and get this, she says she’d even vote for donald trump in the upcoming election — what she calls “supporting a friend.” > > “i saw him [donald] recently, and he said i looked good,” harth said. “i have nothing but good things to say about donald.” <eos> >and he said i looked good eye rape reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <eos> he really seems like a nice guy, even to those that have screwed him over, like this chick. <eos> yeah, you're right, i forgot about this one. no one talks about it because she (the accuser) dated trump after the events she described. completely debunked. here is her from this year saying she is voting for trump: http://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-former-attempted-rape-accuser-now-says-shed-vote-for-him/ "in her interview with lawnews, harth said that she was “pressured” to file the lawsuit and did so “under duress,” adding, “the allegations were twisted and embellished. everything could be looked at in a different way.” no one is going to wait to sue a multi-billionaire if he did something wrong or not, i can guarantee you that <eos> makes sense. thanks. <eos> > he was the best man at her second wedding mfw you're so alpha they ask you to be the best man at your ex wife's wedding <eos> trump's the best man at any wedding he attends <eos> grooms involuntarily cuckold themselves as he passes by. can't handle the alpha presence. <eos> six foot 20, fucking killing for fun. <eos> he's coming **he's coming** # he's coming <eos> he'll kick you apart **he'll kick you apart** <eos> somebody needs to redo that song for trump... <eos> i love you goddamn goofuses. <eos> lol there was a great one about jfk <eos> he'll save the children, but not the liberal children <eos> cnn: donald trump once held an opponent's wife's hand in a jar of acid -- at a party <eos> i heard that motherfucker has like... 30 goddamn dicks. <eos> it's all fake stories to hide the avalanche of wikileaks destroying hillary's campaign. hillary is appearing at no events in october. i wish she would stay hid forever. <eos> [removed] <eos> johnny five is alive! <eos> it triggered their memory or maybe it was the large donation to their bank accounts. either way, they identify as a victim and no fucking white male can say otherwise. <eos> i'm sure all these accusers were queued up and they were waiting to drop them at the right time. this was clearly all planned out and coordinated. i wish we had some hacked emails from the past couple of months. there would probably be some tidbits in them about the planning of all this. <eos> yes, these attacks were planned back in spring already, from what the leaks seem to suggest. <eos> lol he triggered the fuck out of her. <eos> trump has been in business for decades! where are all the eeoc sanctions and lawsuits he lost for harassment and discrimination associated with his enterprise? there are none! trump is clean and an honorable man. the slander from the establishment and msm is nothing i have ever seen in my lifetime. we need to put a microscope on the entire establishment. only trump will make america great again! <eos> exactly. why did nbc allow him to host the apprentice for 9 years? shouldn't they have been worried he might grope a contestant? they already had the billy bush tape. is it because he was never a threat to anyone? now that he is an actual threat to the globalists, political establishment and corporate media all the snakes are coming out. <eos> julian assange had no rape accusers until he cross clinton. <eos> they were building up the narrative that he was bad for woman with the miss universe thing, the tapes, and finally the accusers. they had setup everything to go one after another to build confirmation bias. <eos> game of thrones <eos> it was done to counter bill clinton is a rapist and to distract from the women that were destroyed by the clintons and invited by him to the 2nd debate. notice the msm has near entirely ignored: juanita, kathy, paula and kathleen. why was hillary not grilled with questions about her involvement in destroying their lives. she threatened all 4. they keep accusing trump of what the clintons do. trump defends himself like a gent because he actually takes sex crimes seriously and he respects women. story blows over and everyone "forgets" about the clintons' heinous crimes. <eos> b-b-but thats what dictators do! as if he'd grab her by the neck and toss her in solitary confinement for 20 years without a trial... lawl. although...i wouldn't object. <eos> i want to accuse hillary and chelsea of gang-raping me 10 years ago. apparently since no proof is needed for rape allegations, my claim should be in the headlines everywhere. <eos> hillary doesn't have the energy for that. <eos> no he had 0 until anderson cooper asked if he had ever assaulted anyone. now in debate three that's sure to be a hill point, "donald lied in the last debate! check hillary.com's fact checkers!" <eos> bill and hill, and oj in the slammer 2017. this is what a clinton hail mary looks like. <eos> it is simple. the cucks that broke the law will get prosecuted when trump wins, so they have nothing to lose by lying or cheating trying to pull out a win fraudulently, as then they would not face any legal issues. <eos> shower thought: if nbc and cnn and all of these other "news" agencies were sitting on this footage / knowledge about trump being a serial rapist, why wait until now to release it? i mean, were they complicit in trump being a rapist until this past week? odd timing. hmmm. <eos> i don't understand the flack donald is getting from the left about his announcing how he will bring hillary to justice... like it's something only rivals in communist or fascist regimes would do. as potus, donald has a duty to pursue justice when he feels crimes have been committed within our government. <eos> you're thinking of trump and clinton while you're in the shower?? <eos> its ruining my sex life. <eos> y-your...not? <eos> naw, they've been holding this in their back pocket until they thought they needed it. <eos> this is what he needs to say in the next debate. <eos> sadly we live in a vastly dumbed down society that will easily believe bullshit on the news.. i am worried. <eos> [removed] <eos> you're actually right, they didn't. <eos> you realize all those stories have been found false. his ex wife recanted, and he was the best man at her 2nd wedding, ms. brewer has publicly said that her comments were spun out of context and put into a bad light, and multiple contestants in the pageants have vouched for his character and behavior. <eos> all during his campaign though. also, ex-wife one is debunked by her own admission. she currently supports him and he was best man her second wedding. no one is waiting to sue a billionaire if there was actually a problem, i can guarantee you that <eos> ex-wife one is debunked by her own admission. i painfully read the second one (ny times article), and a majority, if not all of it is hearsay and nobody alleges any sexual misconduct. the third one doesn't accuse him of any sexual misconduct. <eos> your comment history is primarily: 1) defending hillary clinton 2) posting degenerate pornography you've found on youtube. **out out out** <eos> lmaooo <eos> thanks for the link, dude. that stupid shit in the video op posted was pissing me off. so unnecessary. <eos>

days, and 230,000 centipedes and an number that is growing by almost a thousand a day. the last thousand in are people trying to decide at the last minute how to vote. bragging bots, pepe bots, train bots, these are a distraction. is i right this, it's late night on a weekend, and there's 11,000 people online right now. i think this is serious time. bots confuse new people. people are coming, not just from reddit, but from right side broadcasting, from wikileaks and from as many places and forums that i can link people back here. why do we need bots now? we've got people trying to make their final decision and get uncucked from the media bias and they aren't here for fluff. edit: except the coat bot. <eos> i like the vote-bot because it is useful. the other bots were fun at first but as our community grew and grew (and will keep on growing) it got annoying and hard to navigate through threads. <eos> and there's a lot of tech support companies in india. <eos> yeah it's really surreal

different india <eos> patel is a very common surname, but it also has to do with the caste system. there's a reason most people with the surname are very well off and successful. <eos> well, putin was actually a protege of some politboro or kgb leader or another; i can't remember which off the top of my head. <eos> i'm expecting a complete, 180 degree switch from the media when trump is elected and the clinton mafia loses all power. <eos> don't forget sharks <eos> so sad that this is a trigger. i know but is and it feels bad man. why don't people take pride in this country anymore? well, i am

(no homo) <eos> ah, the old "jacket over the legs to pretend their cold but you're just hiding your (freedom) boner" trick. <eos> love hindus. i play basketball with some, nice guys. <eos> the sons of his opponents wish they he was their dad. <eos> they also intentionally pushed stories full of holes and inconsistencies in order to force trump supporters to debunk the accusers. this then allows hillary political cover for everything she did to destroy bill's accusers. the fact that bill's accusers are credible, with dna evidence, eyewitness accounts, and consistent histories going back thirty years is all conveniently ignored. the media gets to reduce those women down to the status of these last-minute groping hoaxers. brilliant move, hey? everyone see how these clintons like to operate? it's really disgraceful what the democrats and the establishment elites who control them are willing to do to maintain power. <eos> maybe #1-3 per thread? <eos> hmmm.. yeah, i can understand that. we should make a restriction/rule regarding the wikileak threads then because we need to utilize our crowd source power. other than those, and if they're not cluttering everything, i don't mind them and agree that they can bring some good energy. <eos> bakersfield sikhs are badass too. the sherrif here is generous with ccw's too so they're all carrying, it's nice living in their neighbourhood. <eos> beautiful person. he wants to work, to contribute to society and make america great again. he is more than welcome. <eos> i think i just realized what the milennials purpose is now. <eos> teeeeeeechnically indians are probably more related to whites than semites or sub-saharans, since they are part of the indo-european ethnic group. <eos> this made me lose my shit lmao <eos> that's a maaaaaan baby <eos> 10 feet higher <eos> #jet fuel can't melt steel dreams [trump's wall just got 10 feet higher! *high energy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qligom24qqc) #total height: 241820ft. we are 80.606% of the distance of hillary's emails if we had 10ft for each one (300000ft)! 58180ft remaining. ***** bot by /u\/tonysesek556 - [about page](https://aws.wariomissed.com/thewallgrows/) - **[taking suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nbt77un01wxb3opvwc8llesd1e8jqj5mnkhitd4qqqk/viewform)** - /r/the_donald ***** if you don't want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you, please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist! <eos> lol no it doesn't, an actual aas will speed up the process if you are already prone to baldness genetically though. but creatine is no where near an aas, it doesn't fuck with your hormones at all. <eos> trigger https://imgur.com/a/reueb <eos> i like them, but you're right. with all of the leaks dropping and the fact many people are now coming here looking for info, it's inportant the threads are not littered with bots. i do like them though! <eos> its called bramladesh for a reason. <eos> megan has jumped the shark. <eos> well played <eos> they are making fox into msnbc by having the very average megyn kelly <eos> [relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-lbp_8z6oe) <eos> stay safe in downtown atlanta. <eos> focus on the leaks that will absolute convince anyone of blue two-faced corruption. <eos> medved, hugh hewitt, mark levin, no word on wikileaks. cucks. <eos> #wad you say, mr. underwear?

"hillary clinton, what do you always have in your purse?" "curry powder!" <eos> haha i love how the little girl got a bag of popcorn "this gon be some sht right here" <eos> get rid of the useless bitch. <eos> hahaha you remind me of my work mate, wants everyone to drive electric for the environment except he wants to drive diesel, loves the smell of it ahah <eos> imagine how much the fucked up media would hate this picture. litterally goes against everything they have been saying <eos> in all seriousness, i believe trump didn't do these things and this is why. donald trump is worth over 10 billion dollars. that alone should tell you where i am going with this. a ton of people of wealth such as kobe bryant and big ben were accused and settled out of court. then there are the hollywood hendersons and mike tysons. all of tremendous wealth. even sandusky's victims told when it happened. all of the victims reported. where i am going with this is, maybe i could consider 1 woman just not saying anything out of shame but 8 or 10. that is ridiculous. the odds of that are astronomical considering this mans wealth. humans are obsessed with money and fortune, if this happened every sane person would capitalize and atleast settle out of court. what a shame the american people are buying this crap. <eos> she's also going to arm syrian rebels and start iraq 2.0, possibly initiating a cold war against russia. i also think trump will win, to be perfectly honest. there are a lot more of us than you think. you know what "experts" said about brexit the day before the vote? 25% chance of passing. guess their propaganda didn't work, did it? stay strong. <eos> are we to space yet? <eos> no...he is **not** anti-islam. remember that there are [muslims for trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5dcuefngmq). he is **not** opposed to american-muslims who do not have radical ideologies...he is opposed to countries with shariah theocracies, endangering americans of all types. <eos> seriously! he's my #1 maga msm guy, he is as good or better than hannity, he's a bit less the attack dog like hannity, but he is a sharper wit <eos> love what we learn here folks! <eos> the lego shirt is relevant too <eos> seriously! he's my #1 maga msm guy, he is as good or better than hannity, he's a bit less the attack dog like hannity, but he is a sharper wit. and of course, he's a texan, like me ;-) <eos> the doctor is in <eos> donald trump was given shit from the beginning. he was never the liked candidate. literally these women could've came out at anytime during the campaign and been praised . so why now??? <eos> holy shit, i thought you were just joking but she looks like an indian ivanka. <eos> ze bracelets. zey do nossing. <eos> pretty much everything is just "he said, she said" hearsay... except they're not even bothering to ask what he has to say. so much bias. <eos> over on argh/poopydicks the media is bitching and moaning that trump hasn't provided proof he didn't rape people. the presumption of innocence is apparently paramount when hillary is being investigated for crimes she provably did commit, but gets thrown out when trump gets accused based on 'he said, she said'. <eos> hammed time <eos> that will be thirty lashes from the saudis. hammed is a national hero there. <eos> you have plenty of extremists in sweden. the nordic resistance just got a huge grant from some russian fascists. i predict domestic terrorism is in your future. note, i did not say islamic. <eos> https://youtu.be/xzypk2bgmpy <eos> the fact that he said "you need to vote for hillary" was just fucking stupid. even if he said you need to vote for trump, you can't just tell people who to vote for. <eos> almost like it's an inside job <eos> this guy must have 30 tv's <eos> not a surprise at all. a few months back, obama said something along the lines of "it's not real popular right now with either candidate, but i'm real sure it will pass after the elections are held". reading between the lines, he basically said hillary isn't for it for political purposes <eos> fox new - judge jeanine pirro is on our side as well....we love them both! <eos> me too! <eos> texas? only steers and queers come from texas... <eos> she's deplorable! <eos> i sent an email to his fox address, and it bounced back as well. i suggest you send an email to his show address with your opinion, and let him know that his fox mail is getting sent back. <eos> haha all good, we have premiers too. sounds like that cloth has a lot of pieces, turnbull (our pm) definitely got cut from it too. daaaaaaaamn that sounds sweet, why haven't we heard move about this? link me my canadabro <eos> yeah my liberal buddy must have read that headline somewhere too cause he said "you know who does that? tyrants! he just has a personal vendetta against her and that's the only reason he said all that." lol ok, i guess in the same way that cops have a "personal vendetta" against criminals. he's running against her wtf you do expect. <eos> except for those with engineering degrees that actually build rockets <eos> just another white supremacist using pepe to......wait..... cnn abort! <eos> don't worry, everyone is wise to crazy megyn! can't watch crazy megyn anymore. watching other networks and local news. really good night! crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable. -donald j trump <eos> it worries me a tad seeing that 25-54 demographics watch hln, cnn, msnbc more than they do fox (not saying that fox is a must watch, but still..) <eos> don't worry, everyone is wise to crazy megyn! can't watch crazy megyn anymore. watching other networks and local news. really good night! crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable. -donald j trump <eos> #pepe lives <eos> thanks for commenting about that! i thought i was imagining things! all over the internet today it seems like there's no news suddenly after weeks of constant occurrences every day. just seems odd. <eos> the worst part is that i'm convinced people would actually fucking vote for him. <eos> what song?

<eos> wew, i wouldn't want to overwork the guy. haha <eos> you know who's as bad.. or worse? shepard smith. <eos> this is why i love my new hampshire peeps! <eos> ok, so let's say trump has a lot of stances i don't agree with, but i also just dislike hillary in general, be it untrustworthy or stances. why should i vote for him then? <eos> #big league barron <eos> if brampton is india, rexdale is little india <eos> i had no doubts in who he was voting for before the video and it didn't bother me one bit. the problem is that he's no more qualified to tell somebody who to vote for than any other random person off the street yet he somehow feels entitled enough to tell his viewers to either agree with him or they're wrong. i find it hard to enjoy his videos after that stunt because of just how ridiculous it was for him to go from intentionally not touching political bullshit which i thought was very respectable to insisting that his viewers hound other youtubers to say that they're voting for hillary. the level of absurdity that he went to in his little endorsement video makes it hard to think of him the same way again. <eos> yeah nice humblebrag <eos> airhorn <eos> i remember that! <eos> so they do her a favor because they give her money. brilliant insight to how dysfunctional our political system is, doctor stein. carry on. <eos> you seem to misunderstand; "no proof required" rule applies only if someone is accusing a person that the lefties do not like. <eos> lolo the screen overlays. putin clapping lolo. the indian dude from the simpsons hanging out lolol <eos> pepe fights for all! <eos> kek at pence's shit eating grin. <eos> trump should grow a beard. <eos> i think i want that reeeeeee throw pillow. <eos> fucking babu <eos> o_o holy shit. <eos> she practically already has. her disdain for hillary isn't exactly a secret. <eos> borders are racissss. he's going to put up a wall. das racissss. <eos> you're the one who's misremembering. with bush, regardless of whether you thought he was good or bad, the press was way way more adversarial. even with bill clinton the media *covered* lewinsky. but thousands of one of the campaign manager's private e-mails leak out a month before the election (completely unprecedented, radical transparency of a presidential campaign) and there's *nothing* newsworthy? they just don't even care about appearing like they are independent seekers of truth. their only priority is winning the election. it is the highest value of their pc religion. even their journalistic pseudo-ethics are fungible if their pc high priestess needs them. <eos> the beard show grow a trump <eos> https://youtu.be/w9tcswoomvm http://imgur.com/ndztqdg <eos> pence feels like a silver age robin to trump's bronze age batman. <eos> can you image that as a statue on wall st?

racist <eos> the idiotic voters aren't even being given a chance to care with the media blackout on covering it. <eos> was also thinking along these lines during his speech today. not one speech at any of his events has he ever sniffed like he does in the debates. <eos> i thought he was doing it to chill tf out so he could maintain composure <eos> i would believe that - i can't even imagine having to keep cool trying to debate that dingbat. <eos> seven dimensional russian counter strike. <eos> i think he feels rushed at the debates compared to his rallies. <eos> well that's true, he certainly is. at rallies he can just kind of speak his mind, meander about the issues a bit. at the debates it's always tremendously rushed. <eos> i kept thinking it was a speech coaches idea! like to keep his heart rate down, temper, tone of voice etc. your idea sounds way more "trumpy" tho haha. <eos> what if it was nigel farage? :0 <eos> genius <eos> he didn't sniff during any of the gop debates and he had some long rants during them. <eos> i don't even know how many dimensions of chess this is - i've entirely lost track! and i love it! <eos> infinity factorial. <eos> 1776d gangnam style space pinball underwater basket chess <eos> someone really needs to make a list of all the chess moves he made against his opponents. he's legendary. <eos> as soon as that list is written down, it's going to be classified. nobody on earth (except trump) should be trusted with that amount of power. <eos> and he's not even sworn in as president yet - just imagine the epic chess he's gonna do when taking office! <eos> it's infinite dimension chess...... x3. <eos> #*n*-dimensional *go!* he's unstoppable! <eos> someone here is shadow-banned. trump's a genius. i have thought that they fucked with his mic so it would pick him breathing up, but i wouldn't put it past him. <eos> it's also probably easier since he's a time traveler <eos> mfw i try to figure out if i'm the one who is shadow banned, then realize i never posted anything. <eos> weird it says 1 comment but nothing shows up. <eos> who said that <eos> cnn: "trump testosterone levels too high; must be taking steroids" <eos> so the logic here goes: >trump sniffs a few times during the debate (i only noticed it a few times at the beginning) liberals scream that he must be on something, demand a drug test >trump suggest that both candidates do a drug test before the final debate liberals scream that trump is "projecting". by their weird twisted logic this proves that he is on drugs. also throw in some moaning about ableism and sexism for suggesting hillary might be on something amazing to see the mental gymnastics these people preform in order to convince themselves that trump is always wrong, no matter the circumstances. <eos> liberals are gold medal gymnasts, folks! <eos> except they keep jerking their knees during their routines. <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dophorpkitw <eos> i still dont understand why people call breathing in through ones nose sniffling. he does not have a coke nose sniffle. if you want an example of the coke sniffles look up some george w bush footage. trump is simply inhaling ffs! its called controlled breathing. in through the nose, exhale while talking. maybe people used to breathing through their mouths think its sniffling but i just dont get it. (and he did have the same breathing technique during his convention speech. its just the mic picking it up thats all) <eos> true. sniffling is what you call when someone has a runny nose and is sucking back mucus. what he's doing is simply breathing through his nose. i never noticed it until someone pointed it out. such a lame distraction for, say, collapsing like a deactivated droid <eos> fuckin' mouth breathers. <eos> **∞ - dimensional mahjong** <eos> cocaine causes sniffles, but it is not a euphoric drug. trump was in a zone that cocaine does not put you in. <eos> i used to sell cocaine and it does cause some irritation in the nose but only briefly after use <eos> he was high on maga. <eos> actually, he does this a lot. it's not sniffling. i've noticed this, he breathes in deeply through his nose before he says anything. <eos> in some of his speeches he does it too. he just take a large inhale through his nose before he says anything important. or when he's trying to make a point. <eos> but you never hear it at his rallies or during interviews or the primary debates. <eos> no, it was him taking a deep inhale before he wanted to speak on something without pause.

dimensional snakes and ladders <eos> literally 4d skip-bo with uno cards at this point <eos> we should all press the debate people that they both need a drug test because trump's sniffing. all we need to do is get #trumpsniffing trending and say he's doing coke and they both get tested. top kek! <eos> he thinks on a level we can't even begin to comprehend. making a chess <-> checkers comparison doesn't do him justice <eos> i have a theory for the sniffles: https://youtu.be/skw-6gqal2m <eos> hahahah <eos> **5d chess ladies and gentlemen** <eos> 4d <eos> 5d <eos> i just want to test hillary for a pulse. <eos> 7-dimensional quadratic dungeons and dragons <eos> mobius mandelbrot complex topgraphical trump the game. <eos> imo calling for a drug test was a deliberate cause to shut down suggestions he is a cocaine user. hillary is far more likely to be on drugs than he is. he should challenge a mic test too- no sniffing issues when he does a trump rally. <eos> but if they do a drug test that typically does not find every drug; just the nefarious ones (benzo, narcotics, etc) we want one that will catch the levodopa, etc. that she is hopped up <eos> she can't take a blood test because she's on blood thinners, and who's to know if her catheter and urine bag aren't going to be pre-loaded? <eos> oh my god... <eos> i think it was from this new report that hillary, in fact, does not bathe. <eos> they're saying you can't test for cocaine? since when? and why have so many sports stars been banned in past few years due to recreational drug use? <eos> what the heck? small family practice clinics can test urine easily for cocaine with a simple dip test. surely the debate organizers can too source: i've worked in a small family practice clinic <eos> **1776d chess** <eos> wasn't trump the one who suggested it? <eos> when i hear him sniffling, it's a sign that he's about to unload, rapid fire on crooked hillary! <eos> that's why libs get so triggered. every time they hear that sound it's followed by words that make their world spin. <eos> is this really happening? please say yes! <eos> this man is a god damn genius <eos> i think it might have just been because he had to share the stage with the embodiment of nurgle. <eos> the reasons she is out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcwzyjbgwje&feature=youtu.be&t=101 <eos> **what dimension are we even in anymore??** <eos> so not really in the hillary camp and not in the trump camp...but in regards to this...[trump is the one calling for the drug test](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/15/donald_trump_challenges_hillary_clinton_to_take_a_drug_test_before_third_debate_shes_getting_pumped_up.html) <eos> trump's test results will show he has enough high energy in his system to kill an elephant, a donkey, and a whole lotta sneks. <eos> hasn't it already been proven that the mike's sensitivity range was messed with? <eos> cnn: **trump runny nose causing grave concerns worldwide, unlike clinton criminality fetish** <eos> hey this is john miller, does super male vitality show up in drug tests? asking for a friend. <eos>

<eos> he's going to build a wall. das racisssss. reeeee <eos> if they win, things will get worse. far worse than had trump not run at all. if behavior like this is rewarded think how empowered they'll be. and also, think how aggressive they'll become given how close they came to losing it all. they will move hard to silence all the opposition. <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qyybtsnq74 <eos> ctr is now officially demoralized. march on brothers and sisters! <eos> **сука блять** <eos> our champion! <eos> #dat sensational beard# <eos> the evil witch will be slain soon. <eos> #ave imperator <eos> i don't see a hindu. i just see an american and his family. maga <eos> holy shit this is the most epic thing i've ever seen!! <eos> give me freedom or give me death <eos> lmfao he totally posts on this sub. <eos> yes, but people like my mom and dad and others who mostly get their news from the msm aren't watching his speeches streaming on youtube, or monitoring /r/the_donald. the debate is his moment to speak directly to these people. <eos> only a true deplorable could come up with a racist, misogynistic, homophobic joke, rolled into one. nimble af! <eos> golden age, you dummy <eos> pence is a badass <eos> #fuck yes maga <eos> where is hawaii and alaska?! <eos> so was /r/politics and a lot of the other major subs once upon a time... for a blessed handful of years there, the internet community was in front of the corporate and political messaging and we escaped their reach for a wonderful, sublime moment. but they discovered where their precious viewers' eyes went, and so it was only a matter of time before they figured out how to blend in and subvert real discussions with comments carefully crafted to nudge collective conversations in one way or another. they couldn't do it for free - someone had to be doing this posting for them, of course - and while money has never been a hurdle for them the way it is for you and me, finding people who believed their message enough to do their dirty work for them must have been difficult... which is why we have the two party system. by polarizing all ideology into two distinct camps, they found a way to spin all opinions as "liberal" or "conservative". once a person adopts either viewpoint as their own, it became easy to convince them to go to war against the other. they'll even lie and spin fictions to get it done, because they believe in what they're doing. they believe that this world can be boiled down to left versus right or white versus black or good versus evil. they believe that the political party that they serve justifies whatever means they have to use to get the job done... when in reality, their public positions on things like climate change or immigration are just phrases intended to win us over without any promise or conviction behind them. <eos> i think the logic is that cocaine is out of your system within 24-48 hours in most cases, so it's fairly easy to pass a urine test for cocaine as long at you didn't do it the night before your test. <eos> here's to hoping that the nyt gets gawker'd real soon. <eos> we could only be so lucky. we need hogan to teach trump how to drop the leg. <eos> palantir is top tier analytic software. i wonder if thiel has some ex intell squirrels plugging away at all the recent leaks. <eos> that would be amazing. if so, i hope he has a good venue for spreading the information <eos> you can play with a free version from their website. great company culture, their dc office has a lot of fun. <eos> i'll bet my left nut he does. he's basically the fanciest private company doing what snowden was doing. <eos> lol the few companies that do back trump will get kickbacks, but they will come from trump supporters not shady backroom deals. <eos> there are millions of people who are passionate trump supporters that want to completely abandon television news, mainstream printed news, twitter, facebook, google, etc. it is smart to see that there are business opportunities in courting these people, i know that personally i would switch over if there was a legit competitor to some of these companies. <eos> gab.ai <eos> if anyone can see the trends it's palantir. <eos> there's an important point here: this is the leader of an organization which has its entire reputation based on picking winners. if he backs a losing horse, it damages his brand. if he's backing trump, its with good reason. <eos> that dude was boss as fuck at the rnc. <eos> he got in on the ground floor of facebook, he knows he his getting in on the ground floor of the trump train. our stock is about to soar pedes! buy pepes! <eos> the wall just got 10 feet higher <eos> #just another brick in the wall.

<eos> he has one, but never uses it. <eos> he's a recluse. a based, patriot, awesome as fuck recluse. <eos> well well well. this is good news, boys! <eos> [removed] <eos> thiel is an investor. thiel owns palantir. he likely has better info than anyone else on who is likely to win. and think of how attractive trump's candidacy has been financially. spending very very little for very impressive results. based on this donation and his public support of trump in the face of huge opposition, you can imagine he will have a very good relationship with trump, and i bet he's hoping to use his technology (palantir) more effectively for american interests, rather than just the interests of completely corrupted politicians and their elite business buddys ripping off the american public <eos> i love him <eos> :o) <eos> i'm conflicted. on one hand it's encouraging that someone with access to all that information is putting his money down on trump as the winner... on the other i don't necessarily like someone with access to all that data being owed something. ...then again the dems already have that data from yahoo/google/facebook/twitter/reddit so fuck it... i trust trump with that a hell of a lot more than i trust hillary. <eos> interesting. <eos> [deleted] <eos> that dude earns respect by putting his money where his mouth is. <eos> #holy shit [let's take a moment to show some appreciation for this high energy centipede. maga](https://www.reddit.com/user/me) <eos> edward bernays seconds <eos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iikj8mcoye <eos> there's way too much concern trolling on this sub <eos> based 5th generation texan standing by. <eos> for the love of boop get this bot a coat! that's 1,342 bot coats given out, or just enough for hillary's weekly sacrifice! <eos> (thanks for the save m8) <eos> boi this is so spicy <eos> cnn breaking: trump calls for fascist inprisonment of political opponent in kangaroo court. and not by investigation. even though he said that at the debate, he's totally musallini 2. why have you tuned out?

either its the passive agressive "these people need to be saved" (no assholes i dont need to be saved. i have 33 crore gods to watch my back) or the outright "y'all are devil worshippers who need to accept our true god". sorry that is not propaganda. if you wish to discard it as such, your wish but that doesnt make it any less true. >tf? if you are an indian american trump doesnt want to take away your job opportunities. if you are not a us citizen then 1. you cant vote and 2. you shouldnt feel entitled to get a job over a us citizen you think indian-americans (even those who are citizens) dont look out for their people having green cards or work permits ? we love america, we dont wish it any bad and want it to succeed in all respects, but we also love our people. and frankly nobody is going to ask my residency status if they decide to have a go at me. it doesnt matter whether i'm a citizen or green card or work permit. the only thing that matter then would be my skin color. >agreed. that's trump. your opinion. a lot of people agree with that. and a lot of people disagree with that. <eos> well, bill did a cnbc interview a few weeks ago where he basically talked about the how great the tpp was.. and a few days letter hillary met the pm of japan to discuss the tpp.. so it's a given she will pass the tpp. <eos> [removed] <eos> your comment was automatically removed because you used a url shortener. please re-post your comment using direct, full-length url's only. *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/the_donald) if you have any questions or concerns.* <eos> me too. we were sold texas a couple days after this. <eos> these people were absolute morons to make such a big deal out of this. cocaine is garbage that's made in a pit of gasoline in the middle of the rainforest. even if he did use it, swallowing it has the same effect without the bothersome sniffles. <eos> a birthday to remember!!! <eos> what movie is this?

you have naan here. <eos> i know the left loves bringing up nazi germany, so i'm taking a page out of their book: this level of propoganda hasn't been seen since nazi germany. <eos> that would be the best birthday president ever. <eos> yes, trump will usher in a new golden age for america. great observation. <eos> that's fucking awesome good job! <eos> love it! <eos> down with the witch <eos> he *hindu* nuffin <eos> just sean hannity. sean hannity and his adventures, sean.. sean hannity forever and forever a hundred years sean hannity.. some...things.. me and sean hannity runnin' around and... sean hannity time... a- all day long forever.. all a - a hundred days sean hannity! forever a hundred times.... over and over sean hannity... adventures dot com.. w w w dot at sean hannity dot com w..w..w... sean hannity adventures.. ah- hundred years..... every minute sean hannity dot com.... w w w a hundred times... sean hannity dot com......." <eos> it turns out that milo wasn't the based faggot that we thought he was. it was peter thiel all along! <eos> oh that's the one i miss the most. welcoming new centipedes is never the same without it. <eos> there are a lot of contentions regarding this among indologists. for more controversy google 'out of india theory' oit <eos> hickok45 is <eos> roosterteeth has been an egregiously partisan one, but i'm not surprised considering they're in austin. <eos> theyre down with tpp... ya u know she... shes down with tpp <eos> i just saw dinesh d'souza on judge jeanine and he said the exact same thing. <eos> damn that was spicy. <eos> trump tried to hold my hand back in jr high, plz help media <eos> viewers are coming out of her ... wherever! <eos> litterly they do not care <eos> somebody one told me... <eos> i identify as a russian oligarch. i demand my billions of -rubles-dollars. <eos> if she steals the election, i'd prefer an america that doesn't have to answer to that evil woman. as much as they try to attack trump, he's never abused public office. she has. end of story. she's already lost benefit of the doubt. she's crooked as hell, folks. let's clean house. out out out! <eos> my erection just got 10 feet higher <eos> first. <eos> it's laughable that he can comment. his conduct in the last ten years is worse than trump ever potentially was. <eos> #it's gonna be painted red white and blue.

**tl/dr** **truth is: russia and assad blocked a saudi based pipeline through syria to sell to eu.** saudi's then: 1) declared war on russia 2) flooded their oil on market to drive down prices to hurt russia 3) unleashed isis on syria to take out assad, while 4) donate $50m to clinton foundation 5) us state dept now on board to overthrow assad 6) **hillary moved the weapons from libya to arm them** 7) blame russia for everything as they must stop protecting assad 8) **hillary uses this new red scare and terror attacks to control the media and masses.** ------ ** future ** --------- 9) us go to war against united nations security counsel vote, they remove assad 10) syria is a failed state 11) isis takes over 12) saudis have a new pipeline and protection 13) dissidents are labeled unamericana and arrested, social media closed down <more below.. with links to back up> ------------------------- we need to repackage this into sound bites. a simple story.. these facts are what separate us from them. once they learn the truth and see the real hillary temperament, that she is more beholden to her donors than the american people, trump can change the world. **warning incoming hrc attack imminent!!!!** **no joke this is the game here boys we can lose it all** hrc will respond any moment... **next master manipulation <only my speculation of a report on air anytime soon>:** *"us pentagon released information today they say proves wikileaks are forged russian documents that can't be trusted. the state dept today also released a statement which included new information on the us cyber war it is fighting with russia. us officials have not only gained access to russian systems,* ***they claim to have secured evidence wikileaks are coming from the kremlin in origin"*** i am petrified of this shit hitting any minute. it is really really demoralizing to think that is all they have to do. trump can scream all he wants the msm have an excuse to not bother. if russia pipes up, they will shoot a plane down. **i shit you not.** all hillary has to do is call into question the veracity with enough fake evidence, then they can plow through our message and keep people scared trump is hitler working with russia. they will say assange is a russian agent next on the news. this is guaranteed. that lets people hand-wave away the leaks. i am serious. unless you find a special counsel willing to prosecute, she is scott free because she will put screws on the inside to stop the main branches of gov from working. **as the fbi agent said on 4chan.. too many people are implied in her crimes, they will look to cover their own asses and help her.** we need to get this info out fast before they do this.. **hillary is a saudi agent hired to take out assad and push back putin, trump wants to work with russia and fuck saudi arabia.** that said, this spell can slip just as easy if presented with life/death issues. if they can see hillary is the actual third world dictator, not trump, and nato, us and saudis are the real bullies, we have a chance to break through the pc bs> otherwise we will have a **girl power sjw tsunami**. ------------------------ **deep background info ahead with links:** waltersear 6 hours ago [-] "...strategic concerns, motivated by fear of expanding iranian influence, impacted syria primarily in relation to pipeline geopolitics. in 2009... assad refused to sign a proposed agreement with qatar that would run a pipeline from the latter's north field, contiguous with iran's south pars field, through saudi arabia, jordan, syria and on to turkey, with a view to supply european markets - albeit crucially bypassing russia... instead, the following year, assad pursued negotiations for an alternative $10 billion pipeline plan with iran, across iraq to syria, that would also potentially allow iran to supply gas to europe from its south pars field shared with qatar... the iran-iraq-syria pipeline plan was a "direct slap in the face" to qatar's plans. ***no wonder saudi prince bandar bin sultan, in a failed attempt to bribe russia to switch sides, told president vladmir putin that "whatever regime comes after" assad, it will be "completely" in saudi arabia's hands and will "not sign any agreement allowing any gulf country to transport its gas across syria to europe and compete with russian gas exports", according to diplomatic sources. when putin refused, the prince vowed military action."*** "don’t let anyone fool you: as we have detailed since 2013, sectarian strife in syria has been engineered to provide cover for a war for access to oil and gas, and the power and money that come along with it." "an iran-iraq-syria pipeline is unacceptable in the beltway not only because us vassals lose, but most of all because in currency war terms it would bypass the petrodollar. iranian gas from south pars would be traded in an alternative basket of currencies." "many have questioned why russia became involved in the syrian war but often overlook the fight over natural gas. as harvard professor mitchell a orenstein and george romer wrote last month inforeign affairs, russia currently supplies europe with a quarter of the gas it uses for heating, cooking, fuel and other activities. in fact 80 per cent of the gas that russian state-controlled company gazprom produces is sold to europe, so maintaining this crucial market is very important. but europe doesn’t like being so reliant on russia for fuel and has been trying to reduce its dependence. it’s a move that is supported by the united states as it would weaken russian influence over europe." "in 1989, qatar and iran began to develop the south pars/north dome field, (separately in competition) which is buried 3,000 meters below the floor of the persian gulf. with 51 trillion cubic meters of gas and 50 billion cubic meters of liquid condensates, it is the largest natural gas field in the world. approximately one-third of its riches lie in iranian waters and two-thirds in qatari ones. since the discovery, qatar has invested heavily in liquefied natural gas (lng) plants and terminals that enable it to ship its gas around the world in tankers. yet liquefaction and shipping increase total costs and, particularly as gas prices have slipped, qatari gas has remained easily undercut in european markets by cheaper pipeline gas from russia and elsewhere. and so, in 2009, qatar proposed to build a pipeline to send its gas northwest via saudi arabia, jordan, and syria to turkey, an investment of billions of dollars up front that would reduce transportation costs over the long term. however, syrian president bashar al assad refused to sign the plan; russia, which did not want to see its position in european gas markets undermined, put him under intense pressure not to." edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qatar-turkey_pipeline http://www.ecowatch.com/syria-another-pipeline-war-1882180532.html deep deep info: **[understanding the russian mindset and history with nato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el_09mazzs8)** **[putin in his own words sends a critical warning to the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fnw5ukyz-m)** <eos> well, we know all about soros abusing the elections and rigging. i suggest we try to get paper ballots. that's my 2/c/. <eos> idk what this is but fuck im excited about it <eos> holy shit, really? <eos> a fair point... i do remember a lot more "back and forth" in previous election cycles... perhaps this one truly is a first in that regard then. idk - i'm half-serious half-speculating about this stuff, so i'm not trying to take a hard line here as much as i'm trying to drive some conversation about this stuff because i can't find it anywhere else. i appreciate the counter points though - honest. <eos> #love me some late night crew <eos> impressive length <eos> i'm an american, a centipede and a shitposter. in that order. #maga <eos> #hillary clinton touched my pepe. <eos> just me or have we had an uptick in subscriber rates in the last week? <eos> we need a list of trump backing companies to support since there's way too many in the anti trump. i'll start with couple. - home depot - td ameritrade (used to be anti trump during primary. owner now spending for pro trump ads) <eos> bear in mind too, this is coming from someone that actually *does* think putin wants a cold war rematch. even still it should be taken as endorsement; agressing on them would deny us the moral high ground. <eos> >the only thing that matter then would be my skin color. you're an idiot why havent you been banned? <eos> i was at that wrestlemania. little did i know i was in the presence of the future savior of america. <eos> that right there stopped libertarian vp nominee william weld from saying hillary is the most qualified.

i think she was held back by the powers that be until the change happened a few months ago and greta left. she saw the writing on the wall. <eos> the only person i know who was in on the ground floor was rush. trump got trashed after that announcement event in trump tower. rush is the only one who stood up for him, said he was taking lots of incoming. i'm not sure he's still on the train tho... <eos> i think the mic setups are better everywhere but the debates, where they probably put a limiter on there, which normalizes the sound and will "pull up" quiet noises to a higher volume. i think the nose-breathing is real trump, and the democrats used it against him. it almost looks like he is consciously breathing through his mouth now, until he gets excited about something, and goes back to the same grandpa-like breathing style. <eos> #346d chess <eos> kek <eos> she's a loser, but not a bad looking loser. <eos> we're all awakening. it's a beautiful thing. <eos> i've been there for training. had a beer from their fridge! <eos> probably thanks to the debate. that was a mighty schlonging. <eos> doesn't surprise me that on killary's events for this month that cuck chris sacca is hosting two of them. i used to watch shark tank and when he was a guest shark he was just so fucking unlikable. he also refused to wear a suit.. come to think of it cuban the cuck refuses to wear a neck tie too. they're such pansies. <eos> this was a bollywood charity concert for victims of terror organized by the republican hindu coalition, so most of us there were indian. to be fair most of the crowd leaned democrat. i can say that they came out of the convention with a much better opinion of trump than coming in. <eos> talk shit get hit <eos> #bzzzzzzt #x.x <eos> you can honestly get all the news you need from twitter by following the right people. <eos> #high energy post <eos> **look at that guy over there!** donald trump is the best :) :) <eos> you can't survive on youtube anymore without some level of click bait <eos> fuck watching any of them, tbh fam. it's all. lies. <eos> landslide folks <eos> is that even legal <eos> she should maga after election day. we need her to steal as many votes away from hillary as she can. a trump endorsement would hurt her. <eos> so many tunes in the op, holy shit. <eos> [when someone asks me why i voted for trump i will show them this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t7pnrelfdy) so i'm planning a trip south for the weekend immediately after the election and i'm quite seriously, for the first time in my life, considering security as part of my preparation. who knows what roads will be blocked or what riots will erupt, either way this goes. and i'm especially cognizant of the fact that a certain ethnic population increases the further south and west you go. <eos> i am staying strong, but the amount of centipedes i've seen saying that she already won is starting to make me worry that the propaganda is working on us. <eos> it's only evident in these rigged debates. watch any video of trump and you'll never notice sniffing or breathing. <eos> 6d <eos> as a female - i appreciate the length and girth <eos> trump women are great. can't wait to have a beautiful, classy, first lady back in the white house! and then the first female president in 8 yrs! <eos> ......╚⊙ ⊙╝ ..╚═(█s█)═╝ .╚═(█e█)═╝ ╚═(█n█)═╝ .╚═(█d█)═╝ ..╚═(█h█)═╝ ...╚═(█i█)═╝ ...╚═(█l█)═╝ ..╚═(██l█)═╝ .╚═(█a█)═╝ ╚═(█r█)═╝ .╚═(█y█)═╝ ..╚═(██t█)═╝ ...╚═(█o█)═╝ ...╚═(██)═╝ ..╚═(█o█)═╝ .╚═(█u█)═╝ ╚═(█t█)═╝ ╚═(█e█)═╝ .╚═(█r█)═╝ ..╚═(██)═╝ ...╚═(██s█)═╝ ...╚═(█p█)═╝ ..╚═(█a█)═╝ .╚═(█c█)═╝ ╚═(█e█)═╝ ╚═(██)═╝ ...╚⊙ ⊙╝ 2 <eos> i do not think it was his daughter. source: was sitting a couple of rows behind him for a lot of the function. <eos> maga bithces <eos> >a ~~cookie~~ **special brownie** baking granny ftfy <eos> awesome! i hope he helps trump shut down the failing new york times. <eos> no bots. <eos> the large majority of my time spent here is on mobile and bots fuck everything up and i just close the thread. no bots. out out out! <eos> we've had enough of this liberal facade destroy the nuts & hippies, the anarcho-commie squads, can you find us, can you find us, we're a moral majority we've even got leaders on your leftist run tv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viggexduxni <eos> #did you see did you see he sexually assaulted that boy his hands were all over him like a loving parent whos held a child before and he kissed him how dare he -a clinton supporter probably <eos> journalism is not dead... we the people - we the press. <eos> no bots! <eos> as a male - i appreciate the length and girth <eos> how about 8 decades?

while all the cucks were bashing trump about his immigration position as soon as he got in the race, sessions sympathized with trump and appeared at one of his early rallies in alabama. despite ted cruz's efforts to win him over, sessions ended up endorsing trump before super tuesday- he was one of the first major incumbent politicians to endorse trump. <eos> #we have the best faggots <eos> obummer knows what happens when you cross the clinton machine. plus, he's a cuck. <eos> i wish she took over kelly's spot <eos> dammit, i came in here to post this. have an up vote. <eos> i am with you on that one. well there is always a chance with kelly's ratings going down and the fact they will need a replacement for on the record after bret hume leaves after the election. <eos> kimberly guilfoyle is a pretty uncucked trump supporter that often subbed in for greta. she'd do well too <eos> i agree with you on that one. <eos> ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ kimberly take my high energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ <eos> 65 years young and so fine <eos> holy shit what a gilf i'd destroy her <eos> no way..... holy crap she is. o_o.... she looks better than some 30 year old i know. being so based must revitalize the body man. <eos> wtf she is 65?

<eos> agreed <eos> i do not watch her and i do not watch bill oreilly anymore. i was going to buy his latest book, but he is shilling for the elites and globalists, he wants to be inside and boosted up. he sold out his integrity for a seat at the table. <eos> they really suck big time. <eos> dude you gotta give it up to vince mcman, that guy loves to be hated all for the fans! <eos> she obviously likes seamen <eos> as an identity politics merchant - i appreciate the length and girth <eos> https://youtu.be/jexufwt_6ag?t=1m3s <eos> #impressive length! <eos> my family just shut off snl. i asked why and they said they were bashing trump. i said just him, no hillary too? they said just him. so can we start a boycott snl trending? <eos> he has a cool name i'm just randomly saying that not biased <eos> the very best, folks. <eos> higher-order quantum surreal ordinal homotopy type theory in space <eos> super male vitality - ingredients: essence of trump <eos> middle eastern people have been christians longer than most european cultures. <eos> pray pray pray <eos> i don't give a fuck if these leaks are coming from mars, just keep them coming! <eos> ink was everywhere <eos> hillary supporters don't exist. shills do. <eos> indian people speak english how it's taught in schools, it's pretty awesome actually. i have a lot of relatives that routinely say things like foodstuffs or studious. <eos> you do realize trump is on his third wife <eos> hannity is pretty legit. i really like the panels he brings on. both r and d play hardball. and the democrats they bring are actual democrats not this bleeding heart liberals like joy. <eos> what happened with milo? <eos> when you piss someone off so badly they join the political party that wanted to hang their ass a few decades ago lol well we're more of the lion party now anyways. <eos> yuuuggee sneks!! <eos> baklava is legendary! <eos> low energy? by low energy do you mean people who know how to read a fucking poll and are over 16 years old and have participated in an actual winning campaign? wake the fuck up. let me know how many people this bot registers to vote. i have registered hundreds, knocked on doors, donated over 300 to trumps campaign and spent a year of my life on this subreddit to have you all act like fucking children and like this is some sort of joke. <eos> impressive longevity! <eos> stefan molyneux and mike cernovich seem to always be on top of breaking news, especially mike. <eos> this beautiful bastard!!! https://youtu.be/orfb98kqgx4 <eos> the trump white house built by staves. <eos> now that's the kind of major investor i can get on board with. as opposed to say saudi arabia. <eos> trump said from the start he wanted a vp with washington experience. pence fills that bill nicely. trump will still have to work congress to get his plans implemented and pence can help bridge that gap. he has helped placate some of the establishment gop, not all are being dicks. <eos> no worries, no worries... i just think it's important to emphasize that this is new. romney was a polite, lovable loser who didn't fundamentally threaten the neoliberal consensus. so sure, the press put their finger on the scale for obama but it was still more or less a gentlemanly affair. this time is totally different. trump doesn't just implicitly agree to the politically correct consensus, so he is by definition an unacceptable candidate. he doesn't think it's a given that, for example, the police are instrument of racist oppression. he doesn't think that, for example, enforcing america's borders is an act of fascism or cultural imperialism. he doesn't think that, for example, america becoming a one party state with thousands of new americans who all vote for the same team is a good thing. and because he holds those positions, and advocates them forcefully on behalf of the minority of americans who still hold those positions, he is an apostate of the politically correct religion-- that worst of all possible things, a racist. and so, in the belief system that is basically as good as a religion for all these journalists, being biased against him isn't unethical. in fact, to not manipulate their newspapers and tv programs to be as damaging as possible to trump is what would be unethical. it would be like asking a christian to be impartial between the virtuous and the devil. <eos> i think we broke it. <eos> wife material. <eos> is that you're best line? it's a little dated ;) <eos> i'm not new here but i have a new account. privacy concerns. maga. <eos> anyone ready for clinton sex tape? <eos> speaking of americana, i wanted to throw out there that, to me, the maga hat itself is absolutely an americana artifact along the likes of old postcards, advertisements, highway signs, and license plates originating from the 1950s. i honestly believe trump had purposely reintroduced americana through this now-iconic hat to brand his campaign a certain way; branding that reflects the strong presence of economic prosperity, patriotism, and personal wealth our nation once possessed. <eos> damn carrie fisher was hot as fuck <eos> what if they steal it anyway? <eos> #based first family <eos> i saw him in cincinnati on thursday and he actually sniffed once. <eos> #jesus fucking christ look at all those angry, minority hating, misogynistic white males! the event is packed with old, bigoted rednecks! (honestly, i'm surprised that there are empty seats. did a bunch of people get up to go to the bathroom at the same time?) <eos> hindus have been terrorized by jihad since 7th century. many muslims demolished hindu temples and built mosques on them, imposed tax on hindus(the tax is called jizya). isis pales in comparison to what islamic jihadists did to hindus. read what american historian will durant wrote about islamic conquest of india. https://www.scribd.com/document/142229342/the-moslem-conquest-of-india-an-extract-from-will-durant-s-11-volume-story-of-civilization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhammad_bin_qasim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mahmud_of_ghazni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhammad_of_ghor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babur https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyanvapi_mosque fortunately hindus rolled back islamic rule(spain is the only other country which was able to roll back islamic rule once it has been established.) <eos> that man is amazing. <eos> i met obama and shook his hand before (school trip back in high school) dosnt mean i like him or work for him... <eos> positivity deceased. <eos> fox eg hannity, lou dobbs, fox and friends eric boiling, monica crowley, judge pirro, tucker carlson, washington times, <eos> will never happen they'll start a war with russia/iran/syria first. <eos> usa numba 1 <eos> evening my fellow deplorables! #maga browsing youtube before i think i came across one of the original founding centipedes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pncq3m_ri6m <eos> what do you think would happen? <eos> whaaaa!?!? <eos> can i get a wew!? <eos> dobbs is good. he was fired from cnn about 10 years ago after his show became too conservative for the network. <eos> me too! we're practically bros now. <eos> it was you! **you bastard!** <eos> that's extremely unsettling. i've been saying this for a while -- she is way too calm, way too removed from the public space. she knows she's going to win because i fear they've got this whole thing fixed. <eos> i wouldn't say she knows she's going to win. i seriously believe that the clinton campaign has been in panic mode recently. she's bit sitting back and relaxing. she is seriously ill. <eos> obama has given up being potus and is campaign for her - if "it was in the bag" that wouldn't be happening. <eos> they have an appearance to maintain. <eos> the appearance would be the opposite though. it's traditional for a sitting president not to use taxpayer money and work hours campaigning for one party. <eos> doesn't soros own the voting machines in 16 states? i'd like to see the bernie/clinton primary stats on those 16 states actually. i wonder if she always outperformed in those states? <eos> - arizona - swing state *** - california - colorado - swing state *** - district of columbia - florida - swing state *** - illinois - louisiana - michigan - swing state *** - missouri - new jersey - nevada - swing state *** - oregon - pennsylvania - swing state *** - virginia - swing state *** - washington - wisconsin - swing state *** <eos> don't use the voting machines - request a paper ballot! <eos> if a machine is used to count the paper ballots then it's all the same. <eos> the fix is in. a 'glitch' will make her win. <eos> correct me if i'm wrong but don't they have to stay within a certain level of variance to the exit polls before a fix is blatantly obvious and begs an investigation? i mean, i don't want all of our efforts to be a complete waste of time. surely there's a way for us to prevent even an attempt at fixing it? wouldn't we just need to show up in numbers beyond what they can fudge? <eos> you may be right given what has been happening in this election. <eos> probably because she's so shit at campaigning that *literally* anyone else draws a larger more enthusiastic crowd. <eos> even ken bone could fill a stadium now if he wanted to. <eos> by himself. he was the 400lb hacker. <eos> it all makes sense now... <eos> and because her small crowds have been gaining attention. <eos> it's because they're exclusive. (to cucks) <eos> it's funny how she has barack obama, michelle obama, and others out working/campaigning for her while she kicks back and rests. <eos> > her while she kicks back and rests. she's obviously preparing for the debates and memorizing speeches. that's why she sounded robotic in previous debates (especially the first). <eos> amazing that someone with 30 years of experience would need an entire week of nothing but debate prep. something must be seriously wrong with her cognitive capacity after her brain injury in 2012 <eos> she's sick. no stamina. no energy. it's sad that she even has voters. <eos> hillary is missing!: http://sli.mg/lhi5ej <eos> i'm so glad it was that picture. :) <eos> and the main speakers on tour.... tim kaine. joe biden. barrack hussein mussolini obama. the deck is stacked, folks. make sure you get out and vote on nov 8. no excuses. tell all your friends and families, too. wear a plain red shirt. make a statement. this is a movement, and the liberal press is trying to suppress it like they tried to suppress brexit. ***#vote*** <eos> she's probably hooked up to a machine in chelsea's basement. she's like a 5 year old cell phone. you can charge her up but she's only gonna last 2 hours. <eos> #hillaryhiding <eos> what if she saw the shit about to hit the fan and is hiding out in saudi arabia or some other non extradition country? better exile than federal prison. <eos> it is that time of year. beasts start going into hibernation. <eos> hey, the polls don't lie. she does best when she's hiding. sad! <eos> she knows that every time she makes an appearance her poll numbers drop. whereas every time trump makes a major live appearance that the media can't spin his go up. <eos> "where did she go?! where did she go?! where did hillary go?! i think she quit, folks! i think she gave up! can you believe this?! i guess i'm running unopposed now. we're going to win bigly in november, that i can tell you!" -- **god emperor** <eos> their polling tells them she is cruising. stay out if the limelight. do not get into a q&a with reporters about anything. let the media crucify trump on sexual assault stuff and make him look like a nut railing in the media (msm make him look parsnoid). <eos> she's sick and crooked. it's crunch time and she isn't campaigning, she's having everybody else do it. more appearances of her are actually bad for her campaign. it would make her the focus and distract from the anti-trump narrative. <eos> she knows that the risk of her passing out again will outweigh any good an appearance can do. in fact she's so unlikeable that this will help her. <eos> just wants to get in the oval office, then here rotten body will quiet <eos> at the very least, she will be using this immense time to prepare for the debate. to memorize every focus group tested response. to collude with the media in exactly what to cover. to prepare ctr with what hashtags to post and in what sequence. trump better be ready. he has to be. <eos> she takes drug holidays from the parkinsons drug she is on. then right before the debate they pump her up so she can stand for 2 hours. <eos> **#whereshillary?** <eos> https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=nujjagjt56g <eos> can you blame her? she is literally her own worst enemy. <eos> [removed] <eos> she's has at least two major health problems and the more voters see her the less they like her plus the greater the possibility of another side of beef event. so her surrogates are campaigning for her instead. <eos> don't accept defeat. <eos> do you seriously believe that?? this movement is huge and no amount of corruption can stop this train. why would you even consider defeat this close to the finish line? maga!!! <eos> what is long and hard and full of seamen ? <eos> as a battle ship i appreciate maintenance so my blades don't rust. <eos> if someone was stupid enough to attempt this, there would be a revolt above all others. trump carries, and he has a bulletproof vest i believe. he'll be fine. <eos> if he gets assassinated, there will be a civil war, mark my words. <eos> thanks for this. what will happen to the price of oil if trump wins vs hillshit (assuming we're not in some terrible nuclear winter in the case of the latter)? how long will the saudis keep it artificially low? <eos> wore my usual weekend maga hat and hrc for prison 2016 shirt. 3 compliments on the hat and discussed trump with a very nice serbian man at an electronics store who hates the clintons for bombing his country during wjc term. this was all in the bay area. sad thing is i haven't seen a single maga hat in the bay area. then again, i don't care if i am the only one. no shame. wish those who complimented had the fight to show their support in enemy territory. <eos> makes me so happy i hate that bitch <eos> trump will win. i have not met a single happy democrat supporting hillary. they are all doing it out of loyalty, or out of fear instilled into them from the msm. it will be a reagan tier landslide. <eos> best grandpa ever. <eos> how about only shitposts can have bots, real important stuff should be bot free <eos> black sabbaths best song was on their first album https://youtu.be/vakheilc4fg!! unlike america whos best prez will be the 45th <eos> i think we should. show snl they are cucks on the wrong side! <eos> lol i agree it makes no sense, at least some of our stereotypes have a good image, being great in math and science, but the rest ugh. <eos> buy pepe! <eos> me too!! <eos> the exit polls in california during the dem primary were off by 20%. 2% is calls for election fraud. nothing was done. <eos> the propaganda is ridiculous... donald against the world. this is not a democracy <eos> so you have a job? <eos> that fracking/climate change email is wild bros. <eos> if trump loses. the libel lawsuits will end the mega corporations. we will just have trump media. lol. <eos> yeah she is horrible it's not even biased as she says. her mouth is like a whole new anger when brings up trump. with hillary it's like an awe shucks she did that voice. coming from syracuse like me originally you would think she would see how hillary devastated the place. <eos> but we lost hawaii and alaska! keep alaska, they vote for trump! <eos> i like her. she's like a more attractive, based judge judy. no bullshit is tolerated with her. <eos> i go to sleep at night wishing to be schlonged so efficiently. <eos> we the people are the press <eos> it's so awesome to see the ratings go down for her and back up for hannity. #nice work nimble navigators <eos> #trump wall #mexico will pay <eos> he also donated to mccain and romney... i dont think is about that matt <eos> this year i learned not all billionaires are bad people. <eos> she can sentence me any day 😚😂😋😍😜 <eos> sweet land of pepe memes <eos> feeling sorry for the ones stay up to downvoting every post. come on you are not paid enough to do this. <eos> if donald leaked some of his emails would the press cover it? it'd be interesting to call them on it if they did. <eos> at fright fest right now centipedes! the rest of my high energy will be used her once i get home. <eos> mushroomfry you are equating free trade with globalism like an idiot from liberal rag r/india. globalism is foundations taking money from european countries to protest indian nuclear reactors. paying kickbacks to get deals tailored to suit certain groups. cause issues with evangelicals in america for certain groups. it's you trying to rewrite history absolving clinton foundation and it's stooge teesta working for sonia group. if you are from r/bakchodi stop wasting my time. it's clear you are equating some other stuff by specifically going after my comments. asian age has an article on her modi policy. <eos> if they hate it they should go to syria or saudi arabia... <eos> wait she's 65? dayum! <eos> #i pray to dyaus pitr and agni, i pray to vishnu and ganesha - - by the old gods and the new - - that donald j trump will be our next president! <eos> what these dickheads in hil**liar**y's corner don't realise is that they can shut down the american internet all they like. there'll still be plenty of non-american trump supporters to further the message, and to communicate that to people inside america. sure, a lot of the internet will be killswitched, but not all. in short, they are fucked if they do that. <eos> i have a real bad feeling rapin bill is gonna end up good and dead in the next three weeks. a goddamn presidential funeral would completely dominate the news cycle for long enough for her to possibly garner enough sympathy points to get away with rigging the whole thing in her favor. <eos> it helps that bollywood is ruled by the khans. it gives young muslims hope. unlike other places where they feel left out and fall back to their religion...with explosive results. 🐸 <eos> wait what? for real? <eos> trump is correct again as usual. <eos> you can't stump the trump is a good start. <eos> my nose has been chronically stuffed 95% of the time since i was a kid, after a long sentence i'll stop and breath deep through my mouth in the middle of a convo. i assumed what he doing was what normal people do but amplified by the sensitive mic. <eos> #usa hijacking top comment to profess my extreme concerns regarding the voting machines and election fraud. there is literally nothing we can do except riot/protest in order to counter it, so let's not let her get that far. with all the leaks coming up and the real damning ones being saved for last, we have to go all out and spread how corrupt this woman is. prepare your keyboard and mouse fingers, centipedes! <eos> honestly warning is a damn good song, but i tend to lean more towards n.i.b as my favourite sabbath song. the entire album is very, very good though imo. <eos> you scared the shit out of me! don't post titles like this! <eos> how about borders within borders *within* borders? http://geology.com/state-map/maps/north-carolina-county-map.gif <eos> much more efficient to put people in a cage and dunk it in a vat of hot grease. <eos> ya i'm sure you've been *inundated* with that line. just brushing up on my locker room talk. seems to be all the rage these days. thank you for your service, ma'am. <eos> establishment last resort options... - suiciding a trump accuser - having rapin' bill conveniently die - internet blackout - starting ww3 - election fraud - assassination did i miss any? and do we have contingencies for any of these scenarios? <eos> yeah bit fifth husband is a lot worse than third wife. and he's been on third wife for over a decade, with the 2nd one lasting only a year or so <eos> tbh, most of fox has been corrupted for the hillary team. only a few good ones remain. (yes hannity is one of them). <eos> i stopped watching her too. she is clearly in the corrupt media basket. if fox replaced her with the judge they would get yuge numbers. <eos> it won't happen. i don't recall any real fallout from the news that the bush white house was giving talking points to fox. <eos> landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory landslide victory

current sex tape with her and bill then she deserves to win. would she have sex with bill to secure the presidency ? <eos> idk if it would be worth making a thread over, but i'm finding a very interesting similarity between trump and nero. nero is claimed to have fiddled while rome burned, using christians as torches for his gardens (tiberius was the anti-christian emperor) and being an all around bad guy. in recent years, it's been found that all this bad shit he supposedly did never happened. when rome burned, he helped with the efforts and let people displaced by the fire stay in his palace. now, here's the really interesting part: the people who wrote all the bad shit on him were members of the aristocracy, whom nero made it known he was going to work against, because he was a populist, like trump. with trump taking on the clintons, we're seeing all of the aristocracy in america (the democrats, the republicans, media and most celebrities), all this bullshit is coming out against him for standing up for this little guy. <eos> i'm in illinois. how do i get a absentee ballot? i was trying to find one online, but some seemed sketchy <eos> i thought they got there in the

/r/the_donald ***** if you don't want this bot on your subreddit or to reply to you, please send me a pm to my main account so i can add you to the blacklist! <eos> i posted a comment on another picture. but for those that don't know what's going on in india, most indians are fed up with muslims and shoving their sharia and oppressive laws down their throat. india is moving toward a uniform civil code. they are tired of this pseudo secularism in which muslims think their religion comes first. muslims have done india wrong and whilst hindu indians are tolerable and non violent people they really are getting tired of muslims trying to force things in the country. there was a big hoopla bc india just got rid of triple talaq and the muslims are in a big uproar because they really want to keep such oppressive laws towards women in the country and hindu indians and muslim women voted against such laws. <eos> indians are some of the hardest working people i know. <eos> the man hands give him away. <eos> even before his support for trump peter thiel has been pretty based. <eos> i identify as a nigerian prince. please let me launder my money through your bank account. <eos> a compressor would likely drop out quieter noises like sniffs unless it had a low threshold. thats kind of the point of using dynamics processing during live events (both compression and expansion). no...either they jacked the gain on his mic or trump was doing it on purpose. <eos> to be honest, i never even really noticed the sniffing or thought anything of it. <eos> is he even playing chess anymore?? <eos> she is enjoying her last month at home before she locked in prison for the rest of her life. <eos> now see, that's the fine wordplay we need more of. <eos> he's got a posse of highly trained killers with him now everywhere too. the secret service is no joke. <eos> a sad day when supporters of a winning presidential candidate must stay in the closet. this masshole knows your struggle. <eos> #based kid <eos> where the hell was this? i ask because....that's a lot of damn indians and while i know there is a large diversity of people who love trump....never seen that many gathered together at once. thought this was photoshopped. <eos> this guy is a certified cuck ignore him <eos> yea, he does have "fuck you" level of money he once said in a video that 100% of his viewers could have adblock on and the show would still be profitable, and saying "to everyone that whitelisted my channel, cool, you don't have to" <eos> indians/all other hindu followers in the usa have got to be based. indians probably have the highest rate of busines/relationship success out of all ethnic minority groups. their faith is of a free mind typology. democrats cant control a group of people of free thinking. i know here in texas our indians/hindus are almost all in some kind of tech field or they own their own small business from gas stations to grocery stores to mechanic shops etc. they generally get their asses to work and make something of themselves via classic american hard work. maga <eos> palantir recently got sued for a frivolous bullshit case, by the labour department, aka obama administration. they've already tried destroying his reputation, now he's fighting them even harder. wouldn't be surprised to find out that he's been helping trump in many ways, besides endorsement or cash. <eos> he moved on to korean starcraft long ago. <eos> i wish pence was more aggressive but i get the whole 'gentle farm boy' thing. it works. <eos> he has been criticized because he has a "mid western likeability". top kek. <eos> does that mean "too white..."? seriously i don't know <eos> my guess is he is "too polite" which makes it tough to trigger his annoyance. kaine certainly tried. <eos> yes! <eos> i love that guy <eos> it's both frightening and truly exciting to be living through such an historic time. this is one for the ages. <eos> i pledge the god emperor my sword and my shield. together they will bring fear to hearts of our enemy and ring freedom with every hit!! <eos> ###five alarm spice <eos> pence is awesome! <eos> this sounds weird but trump looks gaf with a civil war

<eos> well supporting the same candidate isn't really a differing political belief tbqh <eos> ya missed tha denounce point. people who left their party to support donald. <eos> hillary for electric chair. **nimble** <eos> edited the grammar just for you <eos> they would risk it. hillary is a hateful woman, trump said it himself. she had a vendetta against gaddafi and we see what happened there. no doubt in my mind that woman would kill someone just cause she was losing awfully. i don't think she will before the election though, it would be after november 8th and before inauguration day if at all. there are more likely things though, like war with russia cause obama is a salty bum. <eos> i still rely chiefly on 4chan and some subreddits where political correctness is not running rampant. i pretty much cut out newspapers and tv news entirely. they're a waste of time, they misinform heavily and now they are shilling for war criminals and other varieties of traitors. i will not abide by their games. it gives me more time to work on fitness and self improvement. <eos> i'm a sucker for guitar solos or else i'd agree <eos> fuck yes i am ready this boner has been killin me for like 14 months <eos> folks, even when trump wins, what do we do about the neocons? <eos> holy shit. jason chaffetz came into my room to bring me a subpoena and i literally screamed at him and hit the subpoena out of his hand. he started interrogating me and scolding me for obstructing justice and i plead the fifth and slammed the door on him. i'm so distressed right now i don't know what to do. i didn't mean to keep pleading the fifth in front of congress but i'm literally in shock that i could have gone to prison for helping destroy federal records and putting national security at risk. i feel like i'm going to explode from all of this attention, but i'm so glad the fbi is passing out immunity agreements like candy. why the fucking fuck do they keep going after hillary clinton? this can't be happening. i'm having a fucking breakdown. i don't want to believe that hillary clinton is so corrupt. i want a future to believe in. i want hillary to be president and give me an ambassadorship or a role in government for helping to protect her from the doj. i cannot fucking deal with this scrutiny right now. the clinton campaign orchestrated these women to make false claims against trump. it wasn't supposed to be like this, why didn't trump drop out of the race???? this is so fucked. <eos> pretty soon nobody will be watching her when she fly's the coop to go over to that ratings juggernaut cnn <eos> lol my one friend put comedy central on a paper a few years ago in a school survey. <eos> username uptrump. nice. <eos> i identify as a rich chinese buying real estates. please let me annex vancouver and melbourne. xiexie <eos> as a guac bowl merchant i appreciate jeb!'s secret recipe <eos> exactly. <eos> i always thought i was a little naive to believe people were really sitting around blatantly saying "hehe, we should post some stuff on craigslist about him groping women and shit, that'll get 'im!" but there they are, doing exactly that. i guess i figured they were a little more... i don't know, sneaky?

with like r. kelly peeing on hillary? or one with rapin' bill raping his way through the college dorms? <eos> plus, the fiddle didn't even exist back then! joking aside, yes, it sucks how he's been smeared centuries later. what about the similarities between trump and cyrus the great? <eos> asian and indian people should vote republican and support the conservatives. liberals don't see those two groups as "minorities" and are often openly racist towards them. even liberal run hollywood pushes some of the worst stereotypes towards the two groups of people, often destroying their image in society. asians are all awkward geeks while indians are awkward geeks that sound funny, seriously. liberals also support programs like affirmative action that hurt the two groups in terms of getting into good schools or getting the best possible jobs. asian and indian people typically go through a lot of racism in liberal areas such as california. the other minority groups (blacks and hispanics) are very hostile towards them while white liberals in those states tend to see them as an easy target to make fun of or pick on. hopefully asian and indian people come out and support the republicans even though their vote probably won't mean that much as a group since there are not as many around. the truth is, liberals absolutely despise asian and indian people and will often by openly racist towards them because those ethnic groups are not protected by the liberal media. <eos> or its a psyche out. but... internationally, trump is fairing better than hrc. (even in israel, globalist nuts. started seeing more of that after blm pulled their little stunt, but the additional physical support there helps.) in the states, more people are starting to tune out with only the obsessed continuing on. which is still a good reason for centipedes to consider launching an [absurdists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d_fvgq1cse) campaign. too many people are getting bogged down by the negativity and the growing extremism, polarization. so the public needs more *kek* this other stuff leans on questions to ping away at their mind... but considering the pissing match is on establishment fears it doesn't fair well... and thiel has been / already is being hammered away, nearly all the lgbt organizations, therefore coming from that community, spilling into others, they paint him as judas, thus corrupting the rest of the pro trump lgbt with the same broad strokes... and setting off the less supportive fringes. so, they pull up all the classic tropes of homophobia and pin it on him, where left has become the televangelist right of the decades ago... not far off from the mccarthyism communist fears being spread now. what was that wiki with fears about public appearances the hiring of elite white gays... they'll pull that hard across both sides of the aisle. or double on the narrative they setup when he went after gawker... can't sell it to the commonfolk - so, need more cosigners from professional sectors... building that up may ease insecurities. <eos> yep - i was. this week..just trying to maga. thanks for the smile <eos> is there a link to the livestream/video of this event?

that being said, career politicians have ruined this country. it's time to give chance to an outsider... <eos> my people! so proud as another hindu american and indian american also voting for trump! for those of you that don't know, in india we are also fighting to get rid of the corrupt system just like in america. even recently in news pieces indian journalists are getting fed up with american media. my fav was arnab literally saying to someone the other day, who the hell is cnn to india!? india is also trying to take back its country and steer away from the problems they've had from muslims wanting sharia law. <eos> man fuck off. read the quran. they're not radical they're just obeying what they're supposed to. there's bias against muslims for good reason. sure some of them don't take their faith too seriously and are super dooper nice and all that fluffy bullshit, but it's not "radical" islam that is the problem. it is islam. <eos> all over my body - like an octopus <eos> they're going to blame russia. hillary hinted at it by accident. it's extremely clear what is happening. hillary is just a puppet. <eos> imagine if trump jr ends up buying the company if they nosedive after this election. going to be some changes around there <eos> username checks out. <eos> huh? milo is doing national tours confronting the new pc in the universities, what more could he do? <eos> good lord. as a republican reddit user pre-trump i can't tell you how fucking insane it is to have a 3,000+ point thread about giving sean hannity 2 hours. what a time to be alive. <eos> underrated comment. <eos> just finished watching his segment on wikileaks.... dang, 10 minutes just to scratch the headlines... awesome <eos> there trying to give the illusion of victory for her... but i've had farts with more substance. <eos> i think she's more afraid of her poll numbers going down every time people hear her voice <eos> it may be that she physically cannot campaign. not my original idea, i read it on the_donald somewhere, but i did some digging and it's plausible she is lowering her tolerance to levodopa (parkinson's medication) prior to the debates. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7936285 during this process motor function is reduced, which is probably why she goes into hiding. <eos> that needs a dank meme made for it. <eos> *osama bin president* get it it right, you cock thistle! <eos> he will be. truth is on his side. <eos> depends on the type of news you want. seriously. if you want celebrity gossip, tmz literally has the best investigative reporting in the world. for basic international news and play by play on isis/syria i might use cucked reuters and kremlin propaganda (rt). al jazeera sometimes does good work. (not often) if i want to hear about how fucking terrible england is, they have the bbc for just that purpose. if i want local reporting, i consult my local newspaper which does a fantastic job in my town. my guilty pleasure for news in the commonwealth is the boston herald. they are the least cucked mainstream rag i can buy. i flat out do not use anything on the tv (not even fox) or radio for anything past entertainment purposes. (i might listen to all things considered on a long drive) when i want anything politics oriented i use my twitter feed, i am following a bunch of outlets from wikileaks to charlie baker. i also use breitbart sometimes if i want to be angrier about stuff. i have never once visited the drudge report. i want to stay up to date on the ever changing gun law in ma, so i read everything comm2a puts out. five years ago my answer would have been nbc and jon stewart. <eos> i think when someone goes through and down votes a ton of posts and they're not a member of a sub, it should send an alert to the mods or temporarily restrict their ability to do that - maybe even temp ban/permanent ban. i don't know. it's annoying though. <eos> fbianon actually mentioned that. <eos> lets be real... i mean i know this is a lot of fun... but you need to face facts. anytime you see money exchanging hands in politics it was a purchase of some kind. the number one reason i want trump in office is because he is far less "bought and paid for" than anyone who's ran for president from a major party in this country in decades. <eos> megyn kelly just took the biggest l in journalist history... #stay salty! <eos> honestly, they're mics. he needs to be a hawk, and the moment he notices hillary setting her mic on the podium unattended... "(sniiiff, snifffff, snifffffff) mine's acting up. " *abruptly walks over, grabs hillary's off the podium, leaves her his, massively breathes in and out deeply demonstratively, to show the mic doesn't pick it up.* "hey, never mind the debate, this is groundbreaking, amazing stuff. scientists work on this for decades, and you just invented a cure for the common sniffles. all this time, just changing mics, who knew? give it a try, prisoner - i mean, senator clinton." <eos> seth myers pointed out that the "public and private position on policy" was about a movie. so that "the most damaging thing about these emails, is that people pay her money for movie reviews" i shit you not i've seen nothing like it. we live in the 3rd world. <eos> i haven't read up on cyrus all that much. what do you see as them having in common? <eos> agreed. the red maga ball-cap is iconic. and ~~the whore of babylon~~ hillary has a pantsuit-printed t-shirt in men's sizes. <eos> come on you guys! there is plenty of room in the basket for everyone here, right? seriously...why exclude anyone that wants to ride the trump train? <eos> let's get ben shapiro in on a time a lot with fox. <eos> its irritating the fuck out of me. i was visiting from friends during the second debate weekend. i overheard them talk about how biased fox news is (fair) but that cnn stays neutral. <eos> amen... compared to that, crooked didn't have a decent campaign slogan "i'm with her" before changing it to "stronger together" for all the $$$ crooked has a shitty campaign. <eos> i wonder if we'll have an rnc leaks where they showcase the rnc conspiring against trump... <eos> quit my soul killing job, (hopefully) starting in the defense sector next week with a second paid interview to tour the facility, broke things off with a toxic girl in my life... things are looking better and better. it's the trump factor! everything in my life has been getting progressively better since trump started running; sort of like the the trump curse of those that attack the don get their lives ruined. meme magic is real. <eos> he defeated that bastard the iron sheikh <eos> what was racist about it? <eos> i'd let her take me to cougar town. <eos> yep. berniebros are frothing at the mouth. <eos> you first have to become impervious to pain and start shaking your head. then leg bomb.. <eos> cable box tell the same info to the parent company. they want to know their advertising is working as intended. <eos> let's do the same to shepherd smith! <eos> wikileaks confirms water is wet: trevor noah decries the toxicity of dihydrogen monoxide. <eos> the sad part is natural hard american work is something a lot of the population has just forgotten. the ones that want to work can't find jobs, and the ones that don't want to work leech off of the ones that have work and bust their asses. it's a fucking pathetic system. i put in 50-60 hours every single week and the wife works too. we have one kid, and the bills get paid, but we can barely afford groceries half the time, and don't qualify for food stamps. forget paying medical bills. no savings, living check to check. and i'm sure a lot of americans are in the same boat. still, i'm thankful for every freedom we still enjoy here in america, and i hope we can take our country back. too many people fought and died to give us these privelidges we enjoy in this country, we cannot let them slip away. <eos> which is why /u/skyrim_irl said "anti **islamist**" an islamist is someone who believes that islam is inherently tied to politics and believes that the separation between the islamic religion and the state should be removed. most american muslims are not islamists, as you pointed out. <eos> for every victory, she grows stronger! <eos> thats p hardcore <eos> she's hiding because they let her. she's not held accountable for not standing before the people to answer for any of this. the media deflects and defends here. the media runs the moderation of the debates. she's literally just ignoring it to a rigged election at this point. trump got more heat from the media over fried chicken than hillary's getting for a slew of abhorrent comments against any and all groups of people, it seems. at this point, we're going to need to just spend the next 3 weeks taping up "lost politician" signs throughout the country like she's a missing cat or something. <eos> possible... bill maybe tied to the bedpost and raped... <eos> my country refused to give me a paper ballot in the primaries <eos> i seriously think that we are witnesses to an unprecedented period of american history. skeletons are coming out of the closet and this generation is about to be rocked. <eos> i don't want a debate, but what did you see in rubio? i understand why a young kid would like bernie, but i really don't understand what anybody would see in rubio. he was the establishment puppet of the gop. <eos> judge j talking about hillary is dangerous because of the supreme court justices and i'm like... she's trying to take us to more war. we haven't had a day of peace since 2001. hillary is just a puppet. <eos> [he won jeffrey over a decade ago](https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=zx9nemgupuq) sessions if pretty based. <eos> the biggest giveaway in the polls is that crooked and her minions are in full on panic make shit up mode. <eos> whatever he's doing it is working for him. he's very well spoken and presentable. <eos> didn't newt gingrich mention that on hannity? something like, people were way more likely to tell a machine they are voting trump rather than an actual person. once that curtain draws shut, nobody will know. <eos> i did it for radio stations for .25 cents a pop.. quarter taped to the letter inside an enveloper every month.. too bad i seem to make a country radio station number 1 just by screwing with them <eos> sean hannity needs to do a special report on the neocon movement. <eos> r/theydidthemath **arizona (11 electoral college votes)- (hillary)** hillary 57.6% 235,697 bernie 39.9% 163,400 **colorado- (9 ec) (bernie)** hillary 40.3% 49,314 bernie 59.0% 72,115 **florida- (29 ec) (hillary)** hillary 64.4% 1,097,400 bernie 33.3% 566,603 **michigan- (16 ec) (bernie)** hillary 48.3% 576,795 bernie 49.8% 595,222 **nevada- (6 ec) (hillary)** hillary 52.6% 6,316 bernie 47.3% 5678 **pennsylvania- (20 ec) (hillary)** hillary 55.6% 918,689 bernie 43.6% 719,955 **virginia- (13 ec) (hillary)** hillary 64.3% 503,358 bernie 35.2% 275,507 **wisconsin- (10 ec) (bernie)** hillary 43.1% 432,767 bernie 56.6% 567,936 **electoral college votes:** hillary: 79 bernie 35 (i know ec votes don't matter in primaries- just looking for patterns. my takeaway? **hillary let bernie have the scrap "swing" states and kept the big ones to herself.** sources: http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results (fuck the ny times but it was the easiest primary map to navigate) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_(united_states)#/media/file:electoralcollege2012.svg note: i added in what each state is worth in electoral college votes. any autistic centipedes get anything from the numbers? <eos> she makes me so mad ... fucking leave megan!!!! <eos> topkek <eos> hang in there brother. <eos> extremely low energy. <eos> land of the meeeeedia lies <eos> lou is **awesome**!!!!!! check out his twitter!!! he has **no fear**!!! <eos> trump is great and megan kelly sucks <eos> he's a trump supporter. <eos> i think you are both correct - you can that effect from - like they're doing with their improper (and imo purposeful) fuckery with both the limiter *and* a compressor. but honestly it would be just as quick to give him an unbalanced mic. <eos> #4d chess <eos> i feel like sean, among a large majority of republicans right now who are praising wikileaks because it aides them in the destruction of hillary...would turn on him in an instant if the shoe was on the other foot. in fact, politicians called for julian's assassination 4 years ago. wikileaks isn't their friend, merely a simple temporary allie in this presidential election. <eos> he does speeches almost daily at college campuses around the us. part of his dangerous faggot tour. subscribe to him on yt, and follow him on fb. he posts awesome shit. <eos> thou age of gold <eos> michele obama doesn't have a benis. i know because of her thick frothy vagina milk. <eos> congratulations mate, hope things keep getting better and better! <eos> dare i say, eskimo bros? haha jk <eos> the cia backed startup palantir? <eos> eric bolling, kimberly guilfoyle, monica crowley and melissa francis are all on the trump train! <eos> even when i was a flaming radical liberal, i dug hannity as a voice of reason. now i realize i have been looking up to him for a good 20+ years. now that i've come around to being much more open to right wing viewpoints, i've come to really admire the man. <eos> oops...you're right. i thought it meant someone who followed the religion of islam (a muslim), but google defines "islamist" as: >an advocate or supporter of a **political movement** that favors reordering government and society in accordance with laws prescribed by islam. **great job explaining, thank you!** <eos> 66% upvote. you must of hit a cord with some people. good job fellow centipede! <eos> she is definitely based! <eos> i doubt it was intentional as well. i think he's playing the right card though since people were making accusations. <eos> this is fucked up, she truly is an oligarch and a peaceful democracy in america is dead if trump doesn't win. <eos> also, first time voters are not included in the polls, which i think we have a huge advantage in. the polls pick likely voters (and are skewed democrat). <eos> he should do it after his second term, that way we can put him on the 10 and the 20 <eos> yeah it sat at #5 on r/all for like 5 minutes and got pummeled. i hope i really rustled some jimmies. <eos> primaries may have different rules since the rules are determined by the party. general election rules are federal law; they would have to listen to you. i could be totally wrong though <eos> canadians are jealous and shit of that spot of land you guys have in the north lol, some of them want to act on claims for it kek <eos> comey is a republican.. surely the republican head of the fbi would recommend crooked hillary be indicted since he's a republican.. she must be innocent <eos> wow, so many new comments with a 0 vote-score. ctr is here folks! trigger 'em! <eos> the corrupt main stream media machine needs to be held accountable. only then will we have a state of free press. <eos> then why does your flair say ohio? <eos> judge jeanine is too based <eos> should be fucking illegal for a sitting president to be our campaigning, or even endorsing. but that piece of shit has been a lame duck for almost 8 years so whatever i guess <eos> snl is always at it's best during election cycles, but i've completely boycotted it this season, and every one after, until they bend the knee. snl has been 80% suck to 20% okay for the last decade anyway. <eos> fbianon mentioned #2. <eos> don't you mean all? it started there man. <eos> every time she is in public her numbers take a hit. she is also not in great health and combining those things, she has to rest a lot to even appear at the debates. trump is going to win. we all just need to ignore rigged polls and get out to vote and a landslide will be ours to counter the fraud from her camp. <eos> i don't keep my support a secret, fellow masshole. i make it known to the cucks throughout this godforsaken place and proudly so. i don't give a fuck. we're supposed to be aggressive and fearless. let's live up to our name! <eos> i was not aware of that. thank you. jesus. i've been thinking this guy can't be trusted. when snowden happened i was glad he didnt, but now, fuck him for not hiring me. <eos> palantir is a well-known cia front company and peter thiel attended biderberg meeting this year..., and supports trump. the company has a capability to hack those servers if they want to... <eos> [our face when.](http://i.imgur.com/0hqyd5l.gif) <eos> lol so many triggered <eos> yea, i thought it was weird that there was only 1 in there for the whole office. <eos> are you saying brexit polls were shit because something they said had a 25% chance of happening happened? <eos> you know another gentle farm boy? bahrockkkk lesnarrrrrrrrrrrrr <eos> all wearing a red ipod sweater. izod fucking iphone conspiracy. <eos> it's because liberals tend to portray right wingers as these heinous monsters until they show the public that they are far from that. and arguably care more about the nation than people using marxist tactics to further an agenda. <eos> kek has blessed us. <eos> it was her daughter. <eos>
